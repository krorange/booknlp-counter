9 !!! Stephen Dedalus , displeased and sleepy , leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him , equine in its length , and at the light untonsured hair , grained and hued like pale oak .
10 !!! Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly .
24 !!! The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate , patron of arts in the middle ages .
30 !!! Stephen Dedalus stepped up , followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest , watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet , dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck .
36 !!! Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid ?
40 !!! — Tell me , Mulligan , Stephen said quietly .
41 !!! — Yes , my love ? — How long is Haines going to stay in this tower ?
42 !!! Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder .
54 !!! — He was raving all night about a black panther , Stephen said .
55 !!! Where is his guncase ? — A woful lunatic !
56 !!! Mulligan said .
57 !!! Were you in a funk ? — I was , Stephen said with energy and growing fear .
62 !!! Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade .
67 !!! Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief .
68 !!! Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly .
78 !!! Epi oinopa ponton _ .
87 !!! Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet .
90 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
91 !!! He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen ’s face .
92 !!! — The aunt thinks you killed your mother , he said .
94 !!! — Someone killed her , Stephen said gloomily .
95 !!! — You could have knelt down , damn it , Kinch , when your dying mother asked you , Buck Mulligan said .
106 !!! Stephen , an elbow rested on the jagged granite , leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat - sleeve .
112 !!! Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade .
116 !!! How are the secondhand breeks ? — They fit well enough , Stephen answered .
117 !!! Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip .
120 !!! God knows what poxy bowsy left them off .
125 !!! — Thanks , Stephen said .
127 !!! — He ca n’t wear them , Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror .
131 !!! Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes .
132 !!! — That fellow I was with in the Ship last night , said Buck Mulligan , says you have g. p. i.
139 !!! Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him , cleft by a crooked crack .
145 !!! — I pinched it out of the skivvy ’s room , Buck Mulligan said .
147 !!! The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi .
150 !!! Laughing again , he brought the mirror away from Stephen ’s peering eyes .
152 !!! If Wilde were only alive to see you ! Drawing back and pointing , Stephen said with bitterness : — It is a symbol of Irish art .
154 !!! Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen ’s and walked with him round the tower , his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them .
157 !!! God knows you have more spirit than any of them .
163 !!! His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other .
174 !!! Palefaces : they hold their ribs with laughter , one clasping another .
183 !!! A deaf gardener , aproned , masked with Matthew Arnold ’s face , pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms .
184 !!! To ourselves ... new paganism ... omphalos . — Let him stay , Stephen said .
187 !!! Buck Mulligan asked impatiently .
191 !!! Stephen freed his arm quietly .
195 !!! Buck Mulligan answered .
199 !!! Stephen , depressed by his own voice , said : — Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother ’s death ? Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said : — What ?
204 !!! What happened in the name of God ? — You were making tea , Stephen said , and went across the landing to get more hot water .
205 !!! Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom .
208 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
211 !!! — You said , Stephen answered , _ O , it ’s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead .
220 !!! You saw only your mother die .
235 !!! Stephen , shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart , said very coldly : — I am not thinking of the offence to my mother .
237 !!! Buck Mulligan asked .
238 !!! — Of the offence to me , Stephen answered .
239 !!! Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel .
243 !!! Stephen stood at his post , gazing over the calm sea towards the headland .
246 !!! A voice within the tower called loudly : — Are you up there , Mulligan ? — I ’m coming , Buck Mulligan answered .
249 !!! Chuck Loyola , Kinch , and come on down .
250 !!! The Sassenach wants his morning rashers .
256 !!! Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed .
257 !!! Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened , spurned by lightshod hurrying feet .
261 !!! Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide .
271 !!! She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang : I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility .
293 !!! Stephen , still trembling at his soul ’s cry , heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words .
294 !!! — Dedalus , come down , like a good mosey .
298 !!! — I ’m coming , Stephen said , turning . — Do , for Jesus ’ sake , Buck Mulligan said .
305 !!! — I get paid this morning , Stephen said .
307 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
311 !!! — If you want it , Stephen said . — Four shining sovereigns , Buck Mulligan cried with delight .
328 !!! — We ’ll be choked , Buck Mulligan said .
330 !!! Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker .
334 !!! — Dedalus has it , Buck Mulligan said .
336 !!! He howled , without looking up from the fire : — Kinch ! — It ’s in the lock , Stephen said , coming forward .
338 !!! Haines stood at the doorway , looking out .
339 !!! Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait .
340 !!! Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him .
352 !!! Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker .
353 !!! Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet . — What sort of a kip is this ?
355 !!! I told her to come after eight . — We can drink it black , Stephen said thirstily .
358 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
360 !!! Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly : — That woman is coming up with the milk . — The blessings of God on you !
361 !!! Buck Mulligan cried , jumping up from his chair .
369 !!! But , I say , Mulligan , you do make strong tea , do n’t you ? Buck Mulligan , hewing thick slices from the loaf , said in an old woman ’s wheedling voice : — When I makes tea I makes tea , as old mother Grogan said .
371 !!! — By Jove , it is tea , Haines said .
372 !!! Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling : — _
375 !!! Begob , ma’am , _ says Mrs Cahill , _ God send you do n’t make them in the one pot .
381 !!! He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice , lifting his brows : — Can you recall , brother , is mother Grogan ’s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads ? — I doubt it , said Stephen gravely .
383 !!! Buck Mulligan said in the same tone .
384 !!! Your reasons , pray ? — I fancy , Stephen said as he ate , it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion .
385 !!! Mother Grogan was , one imagines , a kinswoman of Mary Ann . Buck Mulligan ’s face smiled with delight .
395 !!! — The milk , sir ! — Come in , ma’am , Mulligan said .
397 !!! An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen ’s elbow .
400 !!! Mulligan said , glancing at her .
402 !!! Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker .
403 !!! — The islanders , Mulligan said to Haines casually , speak frequently of the collector of prepuces . — How much , sir ? asked the old woman .
404 !!! — A quart , Stephen said .
415 !!! — It is indeed , ma’am , Buck Mulligan said , pouring milk into their cups .
420 !!! the old woman asked .
421 !!! — I am , ma’am , Buck Mulligan answered .
423 !!! Stephen listened in scornful silence .
427 !!! Stephen asked her .
429 !!! the old woman said to Haines .
430 !!! Haines spoke to her again a longer speech , confidently . — Irish , Buck Mulligan said .
432 !!! Are you from the west , sir ? — I am an Englishman , Haines answered .
433 !!! — He ’s English , Buck Mulligan said , and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland .
434 !!! — Sure we ought to , the old woman said , and I ’m ashamed I do n’t speak the language myself .
436 !!! — Grand is no name for it , said Buck Mulligan .
439 !!! Would you like a cup , ma’am ? — No , thank you , sir , the old woman said , slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go .
440 !!! Haines said to her : — Have you your bill ?
442 !!! Stephen filled again the three cups . — Bill , sir ?
446 !!! Buck Mulligan sighed and , having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides , stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets . — Pay up and look pleasant , Haines said to him , smiling .
447 !!! Stephen filled a third cup , a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk .
448 !!! Buck Mulligan brought up a florin , twisted it round in his fingers and cried : — A miracle !
451 !!! Stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand .
461 !!! Today the bards must drink and junket .
462 !!! Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty .
463 !!! — That reminds me , Haines said , rising , that I have to visit your national library today .
464 !!! — Our swim first , Buck Mulligan said .
466 !!! Then he said to Haines : — The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month .
467 !!! — All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream , Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf .
468 !!! Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke : — I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me .
475 !!! Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen ’s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone : — Wait till you hear him on Hamlet , Haines .
476 !!! — Well , I mean it , Haines said , still speaking to Stephen .
479 !!! Stephen asked .
480 !!! Haines laughed and , as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock , said : — I do n’t know , I ’m sure .
482 !!! Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour : — You put your hoof in it now .
485 !!! Stephen said .
490 !!! — I blow him out about you , Buck Mulligan said , and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes .
491 !!! — I see little hope , Stephen said , from her or from him .
492 !!! Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen ’s arm . — From me , Kinch , he said .
511 !!! Stephen picked it up and put it on .
512 !!! Haines called to them from the doorway : — Are you coming , you fellows ? — I ’m ready , Buck Mulligan answered , going towards the door .
516 !!! Stephen , taking his ashplant from its leaningplace , followed them out and , as they went down the ladder , pulled to the slow iron door and locked it .
519 !!! — I have it , Stephen said , preceding them .
523 !!! How dare you , sir ! Haines asked : — Do you pay rent for this tower ? — Twelve quid , Buck Mulligan said . — To the secretary of state for war , Stephen added over his shoulder .
524 !!! They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last : — Rather bleak in wintertime , I should say .
526 !!! — Billy Pitt had them built , Buck Mulligan said , when the French were on the sea .
529 !!! Haines asked Stephen . — No , no , Buck Mulligan shouted in pain .
532 !!! He turned to Stephen , saying , as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat : — You could n’t manage it under three pints , Kinch , could you ? — It has waited so long , Stephen said listlessly , it can wait longer .
533 !!! — You pique my curiosity , Haines said amiably .
534 !!! Is it some paradox ? — Pooh ! Buck Mulligan said .
537 !!! He proves by algebra that Hamlet ’s grandson is Shakespeare ’s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father .
539 !!! Haines said , beginning to point at Stephen .
541 !!! Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and , bending in loose laughter , said to Stephen ’s ear : — O , shade of Kinch the elder !
542 !!! Japhet in search of a father ! — We ’re always tired in the morning , Stephen said to Haines .
544 !!! Buck Mulligan , walking forward again , raised his hands .
546 !!! — I mean to say , Haines explained to Stephen as they followed , this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore .
548 !!! That beetles o’er his base into the sea , _ is n’t it ? Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak .
550 !!! — It ’s a wonderful tale , Haines said , bringing them to halt again .
560 !!! My mother ’s a jew , my father ’s a bird .
571 !!! Haines , who had been laughing guardedly , walked on beside Stephen and said : — We ought n’t to laugh , I suppose .
576 !!! Joseph the Joiner ? — The ballad of joking Jesus , Stephen answered .
577 !!! — O , Haines said , you have heard it before ?
578 !!! — Three times a day , after meals , Stephen said drily .
580 !!! Haines asked .
583 !!! — There ’s only one sense of the word , it seems to me , Stephen said .
584 !!! Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone .
586 !!! — Thank you , Stephen said , taking a cigarette .
587 !!! Haines helped himself and snapped the case to .
592 !!! You do n’t stand for that , I suppose ? — You behold in me , Stephen said with grim displeasure , a horrible example of free thought .
606 !!! — After all , Haines began ...
607 !!! Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind .
610 !!! — I am a servant of two masters , Stephen said , an English and an Italian .
612 !!! Haines said .
615 !!! — And a third , Stephen said , there is who wants me for odd jobs .
617 !!! Haines said again .
618 !!! What do you mean ? — The imperial British state , Stephen answered , his colour rising , and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church .
619 !!! Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke .
621 !!! An Irishman must think like that , I daresay .
626 !!! Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus , the voices blended , singing alone loud in affirmation : and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs .
628 !!! Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one , and Arius , warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father , and Valentine , spurning Christ ’s terrene body , and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son .
629 !!! Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger .
636 !!! Nom de Dieu ! _ — Of course I ’m a Britisher , Haines ’s voice said , and I feel as one .
639 !!! Two men stood at the verge of the cliff , watching : businessman , boatman .
641 !!! The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain .
649 !!! Buck Mulligan stood on a stone , in shirtsleeves , his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder .
650 !!! A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him , moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water .
651 !!! — Is the brother with you , Malachi ? — Down in Westmeath .
658 !!! Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots .
659 !!! An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face .
661 !!! Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and , glancing at Haines and Stephen , crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone .
662 !!! — Seymour ’s back in town , the young man said , grasping again his spur of rock .
665 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
669 !!! The father is rotto with money .
672 !!! Buck Mulligan said .
673 !!! He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up , saying tritely : — Redheaded women buck like goats .
682 !!! The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes .
683 !!! Haines sat down on a stone , smoking .
685 !!! Buck Mulligan asked .
686 !!! — Later on , Haines said .
688 !!! Stephen turned away .
690 !!! — Give us that key , Kinch , Buck Mulligan said , to keep my chemise flat .
691 !!! Stephen handed him the key .
692 !!! Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes .
695 !!! Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap .
697 !!! Buck Mulligan erect , with joined hands before him , said solemnly : — He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord .
700 !!! — We ’ll see you again , Haines said , turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish .
702 !!! Half twelve . — Good , Stephen said .
723 !!! B. C. — Asculum , Stephen said , glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book .
732 !!! — You , Armstrong , Stephen said .
734 !!! Ask me , sir , Comyn said .
740 !!! Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips .
742 !!! Welloff people , proud that their eldest son was in the navy .
747 !!! Armstrong looked round at his classmates , silly glee in profile .
748 !!! In a moment they will laugh more loudly , aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay .
749 !!! — Tell me now , Stephen said , poking the boy ’s shoulder with the book , what is a pier .
750 !!! — A pier , sir , Armstrong said .
764 !!! — Kingstown pier , Stephen said .
767 !!! Comyn asked .
777 !!! Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam ’s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death .
784 !!! Stephen asked , opening another book . — _
785 !!! Weep no more , _ Comyn said .
786 !!! — Go on then , Talbot . — And the story , sir ? — After , Stephen said .
788 !!! A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel .
797 !!! The soul is in a manner all that is : the soul is the form of forms .
799 !!! Talbot repeated : _
801 !!! Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves , Through the dear might ... _ — Turn over , Stephen said quietly .
804 !!! Talbot asked simply , bending forward .
810 !!! To Caesar what is Caesar ’s , to God what is God ’s .
813 !!! My father gave me seeds to sow .
814 !!! Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel .
816 !!! Stephen asked .
821 !!! Stephen asked .
825 !!! This is the riddle , Stephen said : The cock crew , The sky was blue :
827 !!! ’ Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven .
831 !!! After a silence Cochrane said : — What is it , sir ?
833 !!! Stephen , his throat itching , answered : — The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush .
838 !!! Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly , showing an open copybook .
843 !!! Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot .
845 !!! — Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again , he said , and show them to you , sir .
846 !!! Stephen touched the edges of the book .
848 !!! he asked . — Numbers eleven to fifteen , Sargent answered .
849 !!! Mr Deasy said I was to copy them off the board , sir . — Can you do them yourself ?
850 !!! Stephen asked . — No , sir .
860 !!! A poor soul gone to heaven : and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox , red reek of rapine in his fur , with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth , listened , scraped up the earth , listened , scraped and scraped .
861 !!! Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem .
871 !!! In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data .
882 !!! — It is very simple , Stephen said as he stood up .
884 !!! Thanks , Sargent answered .
886 !!! — You had better get your stick and go out to the others , Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy ’s graceless form .
889 !!! — Sargent ! — Run on , Stephen said .
890 !!! Mr Deasy is calling you .
891 !!! He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife .
892 !!! They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet .
895 !!! he cried continually without listening . — Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side , sir , Stephen said .
896 !!! — Will you wait in my study for a moment , Mr Deasy said , till I restore order here .
904 !!! And snug in their spooncase of purple plush , faded , the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles : world without end .
906 !!! Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table .
915 !!! — Three , Mr Deasy said , turning his little savingsbox about in his hand .
920 !!! Sixpences , halfcrowns .
926 !!! — Thank you , sir , Stephen said , gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers .
927 !!! — No thanks at all , Mr Deasy said .
931 !!! A lump in my pocket : symbols soiled by greed and misery . — Do n’t carry it like that , Mr Deasy said .
936 !!! — Mine would be often empty , Stephen said .
942 !!! — Because you do n’t save , Mr Deasy said , pointing his finger .
948 !!! But what does Shakespeare say ?
951 !!! _ — Iago , Stephen murmured .
953 !!! — He knew what money was , Mr Deasy said .
959 !!! His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay : it seems history is to blame : on me and on my words , unhating . — That on his empire , Stephen said , the sun never sets .
961 !!! Mr Deasy cried .
963 !!! A French Celt said that .
983 !!! — For the moment , no , Stephen answered .
984 !!! Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight , putting back his savingsbox .
988 !!! — I fear those big words , Stephen said , which make us so unhappy .
989 !!! Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs : Albert Edward , prince of Wales .
993 !!! Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O’Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue ?
994 !!! You fenians forget some things .
999 !!! Croppies lie down .
1000 !!! Stephen sketched a brief gesture .
1001 !!! — I have rebel blood in me too , Mr Deasy said .
1005 !!! — Alas , Stephen said .
1006 !!! — _ Per vias rectas _ , Mr Deasy said firmly , was his motto .
1018 !!! — That reminds me , Mr Deasy said .
1029 !!! Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence .
1030 !!! Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage , their meek heads poised in air : lord Hastings ’ _
1034 !!! Elfin riders sat them , watchful of a sign .
1036 !!! — Full stop , Mr Deasy bade his keys .
1038 !!! But prompt ventilation of this allimportant question ... _ Where Cranly led me to get rich quick , hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes , amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen , over the motley slush .
1050 !!! — Now then , Mr Deasy said , rising .
1052 !!! Stephen stood up .
1053 !!! — I have put the matter into a nutshell , Mr Deasy said .
1059 ::: Our cattle trade .
1070 !!! Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on . Foot and mouth disease .
1083 !!! — I want that to be printed and read , Mr Deasy said .
1087 !!! My cousin , Blackwood Price , writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there .
1100 !!! As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction .
1107 !!! — A merchant , Stephen said , is one who buys cheap and sells dear , jew or gentile , is he not ? — They sinned against the light , Mr Deasy said gravely .
1110 !!! On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers .
1114 !!! Their full slow eyes belied the words , the gestures eager and unoffending , but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain .
1117 !!! A hoard heaped by the roadside : plundered and passing on .
1120 !!! Stephen said . — What do you mean ?
1121 !!! Mr Deasy asked .
1126 !!! — History , Stephen said , is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake .
1127 !!! From the playfield the boys raised a shout .
1129 !!! What if that nightmare gave you a back kick ? — The ways of the Creator are not our ways , Mr Deasy said .
1131 !!! Stephen jerked his thumb towards the window , saying : — That is God . Hooray !
1133 !!! Mr Deasy asked .
1134 !!! — A shout in the street , Stephen answered , shrugging his shoulders .
1135 !!! Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers .
1139 !!! A woman brought sin into the world .
1140 !!! For a woman who was no better than she should be , Helen , the runaway wife of Menelaus , ten years the Greeks made war on Troy .
1141 !!! A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here , MacMurrough ’s wife and her leman , O’Rourke , prince of Breffni .
1142 !!! A woman too brought Parnell low .
1147 !!! Stephen raised the sheets in his hand .
1149 !!! — I foresee , Mr Deasy said , that you will not remain here very long at this work .
1152 !!! — A learner rather , Stephen said .
1154 !!! Mr Deasy shook his head .
1159 !!! Stephen rustled the sheets again .
1161 !!! — Yes , Mr Deasy said .
1167 !!! _ — I will try , Stephen said , and let you know tomorrow .
1169 !!! — That will do , Mr Deasy said briskly .
1174 !!! — The Evening Telegraph ... _ — That will do , Mr Deasy said .
1177 !!! — Good morning , sir , Stephen said , putting the sheets in his pocket .
1179 !!! — Not at all , Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk .
1181 !!! — Good morning , sir , Stephen said again , bowing to his bent back .
1185 !!! Mulligan will dub me a new name : the bullockbefriending bard .
1186 !!! — Mr Dedalus ! Running after me .
1189 !!! — Yes , sir , Stephen said , turning back at the gate .
1190 !!! Mr Deasy halted , breathing hard and swallowing his breath .
1198 !!! Stephen asked , beginning to smile .
1199 !!! — Because she never let them in , Mr Deasy said solemnly .
1214 !!! Bald he was and a millionaire , _ maestro di color che sanno _ .
1220 !!! Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells .
1238 !!! Dominie Deasy kens them a ’ .
1240 !!! Rhythm begins , you see .
1257 !!! Mrs Florence MacCabe , relict of the late Patk MacCabe , deeply lamented , of Bride Street .
1279 !!! Is that then the divine substance wherein Father and Son are consubstantial ?
1280 !!! Where is poor dear Arius to try conclusions ?
1301 !!! And and and and tell us , Stephen , how is uncle Si ?
1302 !!! O , weeping God , the things I married into !
1306 !!! And skeweyed Walter sirring his father , no less !
1310 !!! Jesus wept : and no wonder , by Christ !
1314 !!! Let Stephen in .
1321 !!! A bogoak frame over his bald head : Wilde ’s _
1324 !!! — Yes , sir ? — Malt for Richie and Stephen , tell mother .
1325 !!! Where is she ? — Bathing Crissie , sir .

4225 !!! Do n’t you see what I mean ? — O , that be damned for a story , Mr Dedalus said .
4227 !!! — A poor lookout for Corny , Mr Power added .
4229 !!! Mr Bloom asked , turning to Mr Dedalus .
4231 !!! — Well , there ’s something in that , Mr Dedalus granted .
4232 !!! — And , Martin Cunningham said , we would n’t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy ’s and upset the coffin on to the road .
4234 !!! Terrible ! — First round Dunphy ’s , Mr Dedalus said , nodding .
4237 !!! Martin Cunningham said piously .
4242 !!! Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him .

4297 !!! — Better ask Tom Kernan , Mr Dedalus said .
4299 !!! Martin Cunningham said .
4300 !!! Left him weeping , I suppose ? — Though lost to sight , Mr Dedalus said , to memory dear .
4310 !!! On the curbstone before Jimmy Geary , the sexton ’s , an old tramp sat , grumbling , emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot .
4313 !!! Mr Power pointed .
4316 !!! — So it is , Mr Dedalus said .
4318 !!! Seymour Bushe got him off .
4321 !!! — The crown had no evidence , Mr Power said . — Only circumstantial , Martin Cunningham added .
4338 !!! Murderer is still at large .
4352 !!! Martin Cunningham put out his arm and , wrenching back the handle , shoved the door open with his knee .
4354 !!! Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed .
4362 ::: Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit .

4366 !!! Mourners coming out .
4368 !!! Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed , Hynes walking after them .

4397 !!! Martin Cunningham whispered : — I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom . — What ?
4398 !!! Mr Power whispered .
4399 !!! How so ? — His father poisoned himself , Martin Cunningham whispered .
4404 !!! Mr Power whispered .
4410 !!! Mr Bloom asked .
4411 !!! — I believe so , Mr Kernan answered .
4413 !!! Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane .
4415 !!! Ned Lambert says he ’ll try to get one of the girls into Todd ’s .
4416 !!! — A sad case , Mr Bloom said gently .
4418 !!! — A great blow to the poor wife , Mr Kernan added .
4419 !!! — Indeed yes , Mr Bloom agreed .
4426 !!! Wise men say .
4436 !!! Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died .
4444 !!! Her son was the substance .
4449 !!! Ned Lambert said softly , clasping hands .
4452 !!! How are all in Cork ’s own town ? — I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday , Ned Lambert said .
4455 !!! And how is Dick , the solid man ? — Nothing between himself and heaven , Ned Lambert answered .
4457 !!! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder .
4458 !!! Dick Tivy bald ? — Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters , Ned Lambert said , pointing ahead .
4461 !!! — Yes , yes , Mr Dedalus said dubiously .
4462 !!! Is that the eldest boy in front ? — Yes , Ned Lambert said , with the wife ’s brother .
4463 !!! John Henry Menton is behind .
4465 !!! — I ’ll engage he did , Mr Dedalus said .
4467 !!! John Henry is not the worst in the world .
4469 !!! Ned Lambert asked .
4470 !!! Liquor , what ? — Many a good man ’s fault , Mr Dedalus said with a sigh .
4472 !!! Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar .
4480 !!! The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel .
4485 !!! Corny Kelleher , laying a wreath at each fore corner , beckoned to the boy to kneel .
4486 !!! The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks .
4487 !!! Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and , when all had knelt , dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it .
4490 !!! The whitesmocked priest came after him , tidying his stole with one hand , balancing with the other a little book against his toad ’s belly .
4492 !!! I , said the rook .
4493 !!! They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak .
4500 !!! Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him : priest .
4502 !!! Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will .
4520 !!! Butchers , for instance : they get like raw beefsteaks .
4529 !!! The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy ’s bucket and shook it over the coffin .
4534 !!! _ — Et ne nos inducas in tentationem . _
4535 !!! The server piped the answers in the treble .
4542 !!! Every mortal day a fresh batch : middleaged men , old women , children , women dead in childbirth , men with beards , baldheaded businessmen , consumptive girls with little sparrows ’ breasts .
4550 !!! The priest closed his book and went off , followed by the server .
4551 !!! Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in , hoisted the coffin again , carried it out and shoved it on their cart .
4552 !!! Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother - in - law .
4554 !!! Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket .

4564 !!! — Her grave is over there , Jack , Mr Dedalus said .
4568 !!! Mr Power took his arm .
4570 !!! — I suppose so , Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp .
4572 !!! Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by .
4573 !!! — Sad occasions , Mr Kernan began politely .
4574 !!! Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head .
4575 !!! — The others are putting on their hats , Mr Kernan said .
4580 !!! — The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly , do n’t you think ?
4581 !!! Mr Kernan said with reproof .
4582 !!! Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes .
4584 !!! Mason , I think : not sure .
4589 !!! Mr Kernan added : — The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler , more impressive I must say .
4590 !!! Mr Bloom gave prudent assent .
4592 !!! Mr Kernan said with solemnity : — _ I am the resurrection and the life _ .
4594 !!! — It does , Mr Bloom said .
4616 !!! Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side .
4621 !!! With your tooraloom tooraloom . — As it should be , Mr Kernan said . — What ?
4623 !!! Corny Kelleher said .
4624 !!! Mr Kernan assured him .
4625 !!! — Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan ?
4626 !!! John Henry Menton asked .
4628 !!! Ned Lambert glanced back . — Bloom , he said , Madame Marion Tweedy that was , is , I mean , the soprano .
4630 !!! — O , to be sure , John Henry Menton said .
4641 !!! Ned Lambert smiled .
4644 !!! — In God ’s name , John Henry Menton said , what did she marry a coon like that for ?
4646 !!! — Has still , Ned Lambert said .
4650 !!! A portly man , ambushed among the grasses , raised his hat in homage .
4651 !!! The gravediggers touched their caps .
4652 !!! — John O’Connell , Mr Power said pleased .
4654 !!! Mr O’Connell shook all their hands in silence .
4655 !!! Mr Dedalus said : — I am come to pay you another visit .
4656 !!! — My dear Simon , the caretaker answered in a low voice .
4659 !!! — Did you hear that one , he asked them , about Mulcahy from the Coombe ? — I did not , Martin Cunningham said .
4661 !!! The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles .
4662 !!! — They tell the story , he said , that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs .
4666 !!! The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up .
4667 !!! The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed .
4672 !!! — That ’s all done with a purpose , Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes .
4673 !!! — I know , Hynes said .
4675 !!! — To cheer a fellow up , Martin Cunningham said .
4677 !!! Mr Bloom admired the caretaker ’s prosperous bulk .
4703 !!! Women especially are so touchy .
4736 !!! Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me .
4739 !!! Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy .
4752 ::: Then begin to get black , black treacle oozing out of them .

4788 !!! the caretaker asked .
4791 !!! The caretaker put the papers in his pocket .
4793 !!! The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole , stepping with care round the graves .
4803 !!! A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life .
4811 !!! Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life .
4813 !!! Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it .
4830 !!! Mr Bloom stood far back , his hat in his hand , counting the bared heads .
4839 !!! Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit .
4847 !!! His wife I forgot he ’s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him .
4858 !!! Also poor papa went away .
4861 !!! The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space .
4862 !!! Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker .
4908 ::: The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin .
4909 !!! Mr Bloom turned away his face .
4924 !!! The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat .
4926 !!! The mourners took heart of grace , one by one , covering themselves without show .
4927 !!! Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves .
4929 !!! Hynes jotting down something in his notebook .
4933 !!! — I am just taking the names , Hynes said below his breath .
4936 !!! — L , Mr Bloom said .

4961 !!! — No , Mr Bloom began , turning and stopping .
4968 !!! Kay ee double ell .
4970 !!! Good Lord , what became of him ?
4971 !!! A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade .
4974 !!! Clay , brown , damp , began to be seen in the hole .
4979 !!! The boy propped his wreath against a corner : the brother - in - law his on a lump .
4986 !!! The brother - in - law , turning away , placed something in his free hand .
4992 !!! The mourners moved away slowly without aim , by devious paths , staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb .
4993 !!! — Let us go round by the chief ’s grave , Hynes said .
4995 !!! — Let us , Mr Power said .
5000 !!! Hynes shook his head .
5001 !!! — Parnell will never come again , he said .
5004 !!! Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels , crosses , broken pillars , family vaults , stone hopes praying with upcast eyes , old Ireland ’s hearts and hands .
5027 !!! Or a woman ’s with her saucepan .
5030 !!! Entered into rest the protestants put it .
5032 !!! The great physician called him home .
5045 ::: A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch .
5047 !!! Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us .
5059 ::: Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit
5061 !!! Apollo that was .
5064 !!! Faithful departed .
5085 ::: An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt , moving the pebbles .
5087 ::: The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth , wriggled itself in under it .
5100 !!! I read in that _ Voyages in China _ that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse .
5123 ::: Flies come before he ’s well dead .
5132 !!! Poor papa too .
5146 !!! Martin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath , talking gravely .
5150 !!! Dignam used to be in his office .
5161 !!! Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree , laughing .
5162 !!! Fellow always like that , mortified if women are by .
5165 !!! — Excuse me , sir , Mr Bloom said beside them .
5167 !!! — Your hat is a little crushed , Mr Bloom said pointing .
5168 !!! John Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving .
5169 !!! — There , Martin Cunningham helped , pointing also .
5170 !!! John Henry Menton took off his hat , bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve .
5172 !!! — It ’s all right now , Martin Cunningham said .
5173 !!! John Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment .
5176 !!! Mr Bloom , chapfallen , drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear .
5177 !!! Martin laying down the law .
5178 !!! Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger , without his seeing it .
5186 !!! The hoarse Dublin United Tramway Company ’s timekeeper bawled them off : — Rathgar and Terenure ! — Come on , Sandymount Green !
5193 !!! On the brewery float bumped dullthudding barrels rolled by grossbooted draymen out of Prince ’s stores . — There it is , Red Murray said .
5194 !!! Alexander Keyes . — Just cut it out , will you ?
5195 !!! Mr Bloom said , and I ’ll take it round to the _ Telegraph _ office .
5197 !!! Davy Stephens , minute in a large capecoat , a small felt hat crowning his ringlets , passed out with a roll of papers under his cape , a king ’s courier .
5200 !!! — I ’ll go through the printingworks , Mr Bloom said , taking the cut square .
5201 !!! — Of course , if he wants a par , Red Murray said earnestly , a pen behind his ear , we can do him one .
5202 !!! — Right , Mr Bloom said with a nod .
5205 !!! Mr Bloom turned and saw the liveried porter raise his lettered cap as a stately figure entered between the newsboards of the _ Weekly Freeman and National Press _ and the _ Freeman ’s Journal and National Press _ .
5209 !!! All his brains are in the nape of his neck , Simon Dedalus says .
5213 !!! Red Murray whispered .
5221 !!! Mario the tenor . — Or like Mario , Mr Bloom said .
5222 !!! — Yes , Red Murray agreed .
5227 !!! THE CROZIER AND THE PEN — His grace phoned down twice this morning , Red Murray said gravely .
5230 !!! A telegram boy stepped in nimbly , threw an envelope on the counter and stepped off posthaste with a word : _ — Freeman ! _
5231 !!! Mr Bloom said slowly : — Well , he is one of our saviours also .
5248 ::: And that old grey rat tearing to get in .
5250 !!! Mr Bloom halted behind the foreman ’s spare body , admiring a glossy crown .
5256 !!! Queen Anne is dead .
5281 !!! — Well , get it into the evening edition , councillor , Hynes said .
5283 !!! Long John is backing him , they say .
5284 !!! The foreman , without answering , scribbled press on a corner of the sheet and made a sign to a typesetter .
5286 !!! — Right : thanks , Hynes said moving off .
5287 !!! Mr Bloom stood in his way .
5289 !!! Hynes asked .
5290 !!! — Mm , Mr Bloom said .
5292 !!! — Thanks , old man , Hynes said .
5302 !!! Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded .
5303 !!! — He wants it in for July , Mr Bloom said .
5304 !!! The foreman moved his pencil towards it .
5305 !!! — But wait , Mr Bloom said .
5314 !!! The foreman turned round to hear patiently and , lifting an elbow , began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket .
5315 !!! — Like that , Mr Bloom said , crossing his forefingers at the top .
5317 !!! Mr Bloom , glancing sideways up from the cross he had made , saw the foreman ’s sallow face , think he has a touch of jaundice , and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper .
5335 !!! The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly .
5336 !!! — The idea , Mr Bloom said , is the house of keys .
5339 !!! Tourists , you know , from the isle of Man .
5346 !!! — We can do that , the foreman said .
5347 !!! Have you the design ? — I can get it , Mr Bloom said .
5354 !!! Longfelt want .
5356 !!! The foreman thought for an instant .
5359 !!! A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage .
5361 !!! Mr Bloom stood by , hearing the loud throbs of cranks , watching the silent typesetters at their cases .
5364 !!! Martin Cunningham forgot to give us his spellingbee conundrum this morning .
5385 !!! The foreman handed back the galleypage suddenly , saying : — Wait .
5393 !!! Where ’s Monks ? — Monks !
5394 !!! Mr Bloom took up his cutting .
5413 !!! He stayed in his walk to watch a typesetter neatly distributing type .
5426 !!! And then the angel of death kills the butcher and he kills the ox and the dog kills the cat .
5433 !!! Mr Bloom passed on out of the clanking noises through the gallery on to the landing .
5442 !!! Who the deuce scrawled all over those walls with matches ?
5451 !!! What perfume does your wife use ?
5462 !!! ERIN , GREEN GEM OF THE SILVER SEA — The ghost walks , professor MacHugh murmured softly , biscuitfully to the dusty windowpane .
5463 !!! Mr Dedalus , staring from the empty fireplace at Ned Lambert ’s quizzing face , asked of it sourly : — Agonising Christ , would n’t it give you a heartburn on your arse ? Ned Lambert , seated on the table , read on : — _ Or again , note the meanderings of some purling rill as it babbles on its way , tho ’ quarrelling with the stony obstacles , to the tumbling waters of Neptune ’s blue domain , ’ mid mossy banks , fanned by gentlest zephyrs , played on by the glorious sunlight or ’ neath the shadows cast o’er its pensive bosom by the overarching leafage of the giants of the forest _ .
5466 !!! How ’s that for high ? — Changing his drink , Mr Dedalus said .
5467 !!! Ned Lambert , laughing , struck the newspaper on his knees , repeating : — _
5470 !!! O boys ! — And Xenophon looked upon Marathon , Mr Dedalus said , looking again on the fireplace and to the window , and Marathon looked on the sea .
5471 !!! — That will do , professor MacHugh cried from the window .
5476 !!! Ned Lambert is taking a day off I see .
5479 !!! Old Chatterton , the vicechancellor , is his granduncle or his greatgranduncle .
5481 !!! Subleader for his death written this long time perhaps .
5484 !!! Johnny , make room for your uncle .
5489 !!! — Just another spasm , Ned Lambert said . — What is it ?
5490 !!! Mr Bloom asked .
5491 !!! — A recently discovered fragment of Cicero , professor MacHugh answered with pomp of tone .
5496 !!! Mr Bloom said simply . — Most pertinent question , the professor said between his chews .
5497 !!! With an accent on the whose . — Dan Dawson ’s land Mr Dedalus said .
5499 !!! Mr Bloom asked .
5500 !!! Ned Lambert nodded .
5503 !!! — Excuse me , J. J. O’Molloy said , entering .
5504 !!! Mr Bloom moved nimbly aside .
5510 !!! And yourself ? J. J. O’Molloy shook his head .
5519 !!! — Is the editor to be seen ?
5520 !!! J. J. O’Molloy asked , looking towards the inner door .
5521 !!! — Very much so , professor MacHugh said .
5524 !!! J. J. O’Molloy strolled to the sloping desk and began to turn back the pink pages of the file .
5536 !!! Myles Crawford began on the _ Independent .
5538 !!! Funny the way those newspaper men veer about when they get wind of a new opening .
5544 !!! Hail fellow well met the next moment .
5545 !!! — Ah , listen to this for God ’ sake , Ned Lambert pleaded .
5548 !!! the professor broke in testily .
5549 !!! Enough of the inflated windbag ! — _ Peaks _ , Ned Lambert went on , _ towering high on high , to bathe our souls , as it were ... _ — Bathe his lips , Mr Dedalus said .
5554 !!! HIS NATIVE DORIC — The moon , professor MacHugh said .
5557 !!! Mr Dedalus cried , giving vent to a hopeless groan .
5562 !!! Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside , chuckling with delight .
5570 !!! Daughter engaged to that chap in the inland revenue office with the motor .
5575 !!! Wetherup always said that .
5579 !!! — And here comes the sham squire himself !
5580 !!! professor MacHugh said grandly .
5582 !!! the editor said in recognition . — Come , Ned , Mr Dedalus said , putting on his hat .
5585 !!! the editor cried .
5586 !!! No drinks served before mass . — Quite right too , Mr Dedalus said , going out .
5587 !!! Come on , Ned . Ned Lambert sidled down from the table .
5590 !!! Ned Lambert asked .
5592 !!! the editor cried , striding to the mantelpiece .
5595 !!! — Where was that , Myles ?
5596 !!! Ned Lambert asked with a reflective glance at his toecaps .
5598 !!! the editor shouted .
5599 !!! — So it was , begad , Ned Lambert agreed .
5602 !!! the editor crowed in high treble from his uplifted scarlet face .
5604 !!! the professor said .
5609 !!! Mr Bloom , seeing the coast clear , made for the inner door .
5614 !!! professor MacHugh asked , coming to the editor and laying a firm hand on his shoulder .
5615 !!! — That ’ll be all right , Myles Crawford said more calmly .
5619 !!! — Good day , Myles , J. J. O’Molloy said , letting the pages he held slip limply back on the file .
5626 !!! SPOT THE WINNER Lenehan came out of the inner office with _ Sport _ ’s tissues .
5632 !!! — Hush , Lenehan said .
5634 !!! Professor MacHugh strode across the room and seized the cringing urchin by the collar as the others scampered out of the hall and down the steps .
5637 !!! It was the big fellow shoved me , sir . — Throw him out and shut the door , the editor said .
5639 !!! Lenehan began to paw the tissues up from the floor , grunting as he stooped twice .
5640 !!! — Waiting for the racing special , sir , the newsboy said .
5641 !!! It was Pat Farrell shoved me , sir .
5644 !!! J. J. O’Molloy turned the files crackingly over , murmuring , seeking : — Continued on page six , column four . — Yes , _
5645 !!! Evening Telegraph _ here , Mr Bloom phoned from the inner office .
5657 !!! He came in quickly and bumped against Lenehan who was struggling up with the second tissue . — _ Pardon , monsieur _ , Lenehan said , clutching him for an instant and making a grimace .
5658 !!! — My fault , Mr Bloom said , suffering his grip .
5661 !!! — Knee , Lenehan said .
5663 !!! — Sorry , Mr Bloom said .
5665 !!! J. J. O’Molloy slapped the heavy pages over .
5666 !!! The noise of two shrill voices , a mouthorgan , echoed in the bare hallway from the newsboys squatted on the doorsteps : We are the boys of Wexford Who fought with heart and hand .
5667 !!! EXIT BLOOM — I ’m just running round to Bachelor ’s walk , Mr Bloom said , about this ad of Keyes ’s .
5671 !!! The editor who , leaning against the mantelshelf , had propped his head on his hand , suddenly stretched forth an arm amply .
5675 !!! — Back in no time , Mr Bloom said , hurrying out .
5676 !!! J. J. O’Molloy took the tissues from Lenehan ’s hand and read them , blowing them apart gently , without comment .
5677 !!! — He ’ll get that advertisement , the professor said , staring through his blackrimmed spectacles over the crossblind .
5681 !!! Lenehan cried , running to the window .
5683 !!! — Look at the young guttersnipe behind him hue and cry , Lenehan said , and you ’ll kick .
5690 !!! Myles Crawford said with a start .
5691 !!! Where are the other two gone ? — Who ? the professor said , turning .
5693 !!! Paddy Hooper is there with Jack Hall .
5695 !!! — Come on then , Myles Crawford said .
5698 !!! — He ’s pretty well on , professor MacHugh said in a low voice .
5699 !!! — Seems to be , J. J. O’Molloy said , taking out a cigarettecase in murmuring meditation , but it is not always as it seems .
5702 !!! Lenehan promptly struck a match for them and lit their cigarettes in turn .
5703 !!! J. J. O’Molloy opened his case again and offered it . — _ Thanky vous _ , Lenehan said , helping himself .
5704 !!! The editor came from the inner office , a straw hat awry on his brow .
5706 !!! The professor grinned , locking his long lips .
5709 !!! Myles Crawford said .
5711 !!! Lenehan , lighting it for him with quick grace , said : — Silence for my brandnew riddle ! — _ Imperium romanum _ , J. J. O’Molloy said gently .
5714 !!! Myles Crawford blew his first puff violently towards the ceiling .
5719 !!! THE GRANDEUR THAT WAS ROME — Wait a moment , professor MacHugh said , raising two quiet claws .
5728 !!! The Roman , like the Englishman who follows in his footsteps , brought to every new shore on which he set his foot ( on our shore he never set it ) only his cloacal obsession .
5733 !!! , Lenehan said .
5734 !!! Our old ancient ancestors , as we read in the first chapter of Guinness ’s , were partial to the running stream .
5735 !!! — They were nature ’s gentlemen , J. J. O’Molloy murmured .
5737 !!! And Pontius Pilate is its prophet , professor MacHugh responded .
5739 !!! J. J. O’Molloy asked .
5741 !!! Everything was going swimmingly ... — First my riddle , Lenehan said .
5743 !!! Mr O’Madden Burke , tall in copious grey of Donegal tweed , came in from the hallway .
5744 !!! Stephen Dedalus , behind him , uncovered as he entered .
5746 !!! Lenehan cried .
5747 !!! — I escort a suppliant , Mr O’Madden Burke said melodiously .
5748 !!! Youth led by Experience visits Notoriety .
5750 !!! the editor said , holding out a hand .
5752 !!! Your governor is just gone . ? ? ?
5753 !!! Lenehan said to all : — Silence !

5758 !!! the editor asked .
5760 !!! — Mr Garrett Deasy , Stephen said . — That old pelters , the editor said .

7865 !!! He does canvassing for the _ Freeman . _ — I know him well to see , Davy Byrne said .
7867 !!! Nosey Flynn said .
7871 !!! Nosey Flynn said .
7876 !!! — I never broach the subject , Davy Byrne said humanely , if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way .
7878 !!! — It ’s not the wife anyhow , Nosey Flynn said .
7883 !!! Davy Byrne said .
7884 !!! Nosey Flynn pursed his lips .
7888 !!! Davy Byrne asked , coming from his book .
7889 !!! Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers .

7901 !!! I know a fellow was trying to get into it .
7904 !!! Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one : — Iiiiiichaaaaaaach ! — There was one woman , Nosey Flynn said , hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing .
7907 !!! Davy Byrne , sated after his yawn , said with tearwashed eyes : — And is that a fact ?
7910 !!! — God Almighty could n’t make him drunk , Nosey Flynn said firmly .
7916 !!! — There are some like that , Davy Byrne said .
7918 !!! — He ’s not too bad , Nosey Flynn said , snuffling it up .
7924 !!! — I know , Davy Byrne said .
7925 !!! — Nothing in black and white , Nosey Flynn said .

7940 !!! For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped .
7943 !!! Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates .
7949 !!! A dead snip . — Zinfandel is it ?
7950 !!! Nosey Flynn asked .
7951 !!! Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him .

7954 !!! Tom Rochford nodded and drank .
7956 !!! Bantam Lyons winked .
7958 !!! — Tell us if you ’re worth your salt and be damned to you , Paddy Leonard said .
7960 !!! Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting .
7962 !!! Nosey Flynn said .
7964 !!! — That ’s the man now that gave it to me , Bantam Lyons whispered . — Prrwht !
7965 !!! Paddy Leonard said with scorn .
7966 !!! Mr Byrne , sir , we ’ll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a ... — Stone ginger , Davy Byrne added civilly .
7967 !!! — Ay , Paddy Leonard said .
7969 !!! Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street , his tongue brushing his teeth smooth .
7976 !!! Mr Bloom coasted warily .
7980 !!! Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his ?
7983 !!! Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free .

8034 !!! A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane .
8038 !!! Mr Bloom asked .
8039 !!! The blind stripling did not answer .
8040 !!! His wallface frowned weakly .
8042 !!! — You ’re in Dawson street , Mr Bloom said .
8052 !!! — There ’s a van there , Mr Bloom said , but it ’s not moving .
8055 !!! — Yes , the stripling answered .
8057 !!! — Come , Mr Bloom said .
8075 !!! Keep his cane clear of the horse ’s legs : tired drudge get his doze .
8083 !!! The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way , drawing his cane back , feeling again .
8084 !!! Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet , a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed .

8300 !!! — Our young Irish bards , John Eglinton censured , have yet to create a figure which the world will set beside Saxon Shakespeare ’s Hamlet though I admire him , as old Ben did , on this side idolatry .
8301 !!! — All these questions are purely academic , Russell oracled out of his shadow .
8302 !!! I mean , whether Hamlet is Shakespeare or James I or Essex .
8304 !!! Art has to reveal to us ideas , formless spiritual essences .
8310 !!! Wall , tarnation strike me !
8312 !!! The schoolmen were schoolboys first , Stephen said superpolitely .
8313 !!! Aristotle was once Plato ’s schoolboy .

8334 !!! Mr Best entered , tall , young , mild , light .
8335 !!! He bore in his hand with grace a notebook , new , large , clean , bright . — That model schoolboy , Stephen said , would find Hamlet ’s musings about the afterlife of his princely soul , the improbable , insignificant and undramatic monologue , as shallow as Plato ’s .
8336 !!! John Eglinton , frowning , said , waxing wroth : — Upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare Aristotle with Plato . — Which of the two , Stephen asked , would have banished me from his commonwealth ?
8338 !!! Horseness is the whatness of allhorse .
8344 !!! Mr Best came forward , amiable , towards his colleague .
8345 !!! — Haines is gone , he said .
8353 !!! — The peatsmoke is going to his head , John Eglinton opined .
8359 ::: An emerald set in the ring of the sea . — People do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be , the auric egg of Russell warned occultly .

8377 !!! Hamlet ou _ ... — The absentminded beggar , Stephen ended .
8378 !!! John Eglinton laughed .
8382 !!! — A deathsman of the soul Robert Greene called him , Stephen said .
8390 !!! The devil and the deep sea . — He will have it that _
8391 !!! Hamlet _ is a ghoststory , John Eglinton said for Mr Best ’s behoof .
8398 !!! Stephen said with tingling energy .
8403 !!! John Eglinton shifted his spare body , leaning back to judge .
8405 !!! — It is this hour of a day in mid June , Stephen said , begging with a swift glance their hearing .
8408 !!! Canvasclimbers who sailed with Drake chew their sausages among the groundlings .
8412 !!! — Shakespeare has left the huguenot ’s house in Silver street and walks by the swanmews along the riverbank .
8414 ::: The swan of Avon has other thoughts .
8416 !!! Ignatius Loyola , make haste to help me ! — The play begins .
8417 !!! A player comes on under the shadow , made up in the castoff mail of a court buck , a wellset man with a bass voice .
8418 !!! It is the ghost , the king , a king and no king , and the player is Shakespeare who has studied _ Hamlet _ all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre .
8420 !!! To a son he speaks , the son of his soul , the prince , young Hamlet and to the son of his body , Hamnet Shakespeare , who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever .
8421 !!! Is it possible that that player Shakespeare , a ghost by absence , and in the vesture of buried Denmark , a ghost by death , speaking his own words to his own son ’s name ( had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet ’s twin ) , is it possible , I want to know , or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises : you are the dispossessed son : I am the murdered father : your mother is the guilty queen , Ann Shakespeare , born Hathaway ? — But this prying into the family life of a great man , Russell began impatiently .
8426 !!! what is it to us how the poet lived ?
8427 !!! As for living our servants can do that for us , Villiers de l’Isle has said .
8451 !!! Molecules all change .
8463 !!! — She died , Stephen retorted , sixtyseven years after she was born .
8475 !!! John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp .
8476 !!! — The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake , he said , and got out of it as quickly and as best he could .
8478 !!! Stephen said rudely .
8479 !!! A man of genius makes no mistakes .
8482 !!! — A shrew , John Eglinton said shrewdly , is not a useful portal of discovery , one should imagine .
8483 !!! What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe ? — Dialectic , Stephen answered : and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world .
8487 !!! Yes , we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her .
8489 !!! — He had a good groatsworth of wit , Stephen said , and no truant memory .
8495 !!! Is Katharine the shrew illfavoured ?
8496 !!! Hortensio calls her young and beautiful .
8497 !!! Do you think the writer of _ Antony and Cleopatra _ , a passionate pilgrim , had his eyes in the back of his head that he chose the ugliest doxy in all Warwickshire to lie withal ?
8499 !!! But his boywomen are the women of a boy .
8503 !!! If others have their will Ann hath a way .
8506 !!! The greyeyed goddess who bends over the boy Adonis , stooping to conquer , as prologue to the swelling act , is a boldfaced Stratford wench who tumbles in a cornfield a lover younger than herself .
8508 !!! When ? Come ! — Ryefield , Mr Best said brightly , gladly , raising his new book , gladly , brightly .
8519 !!! Piper is coming . — Piper !
8521 !!! Is Piper back ? Peter Piper pecked a peck of pick of peck of pickled pepper .
8531 !!! The faithful hermetists await the light , ripe for chelaship , ringroundabout him .
8534 !!! Lotus ladies tend them i’the eyes , their pineal glands aglow .
8536 !!! Gulfer of souls , engulfer .
8540 !!! — They say we are to have a literary surprise , the quaker librarian said , friendly and earnest .
8541 !!! Mr Russell , rumour has it , is gathering together a sheaf of our younger poets ’ verses .
8546 !!! Stephen looked down on a wide headless caubeen , hung on his ashplanthandle over his knee .
8552 !!! Argal , one hat is one hat .
8555 !!! George Roberts is doing the commercial part .
8556 !!! Longworth will give it a good puff in the _ Express .
8563 !!! Yeats admired his line : _
8567 !!! Malachi Mulligan is coming too .
8568 !!! Moore asked him to bring Haines .
8570 !!! That Moore is Martyn ’s wild oats ?
8573 !!! Our national epic has yet to be written , Dr Sigerson says .
8574 !!! Moore is the man for it .
8580 !!! James Stephens is doing some clever sketches .
8586 !!! Lir ’s loneliest daughter . Nookshotten .
8588 !!! — Thank you very much , Mr Russell , Stephen said , rising .
8592 !!! — I understand , Stephen said .
8597 !!! Synge has promised me an article for _ Dana _ too .
8603 !!! Stephen sat down .
8604 !!! The quaker librarian came from the leavetakers .
8605 !!! Blushing , his mask said : — Mr Dedalus , your views are most illuminating .
8609 !!! Courtesy or an inward light ? — Where there is a reconciliation , Stephen said , there must have been first a sundering .
8612 !!! Women he won to him , tender people , a whore of Babylon , ladies of justices , bully tapsters ’ wives .
8620 !!! Here he ponders things that were not : what Cæsar would have lived to do had he believed the soothsayer : what might have been : possibilities of the possible as possible : things not known : what name Achilles bore when he lived among women .
8630 !!! — Certainly , John Eglinton mused , of all great men he is the most enigmatic .
8636 !!! Mr Best pleaded .
8645 !!! Quoth littlejohn Eglinton : — I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you .
8647 !!! Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows .
8650 !!! E quando vede l’uomo l’attosca _ .
8652 !!! — As we , or mother Dana , weave and unweave our bodies , Stephen said , from day to day , their molecules shuttled to and fro , so does the artist weave and unweave his image .
8653 !!! And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born , though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time , so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth .
8654 !!! In the intense instant of imagination , when the mind , Shelley says , is a fading coal , that which I was is that which I am and that which in possibility I may come to be .
8655 !!! So in the future , the sister of the past , I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be .
8656 !!! Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile .
8657 !!! — Yes , Mr Best said youngly .
8663 !!! — That mole is the last to go , Stephen said , laughing .
8664 !!! John Eglinton made a nothing pleasing mow .
8665 !!! — If that were the birthmark of genius , he said , genius would be a drug in the market .
8666 !!! The plays of Shakespeare ’s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit .
8667 !!! — The spirit of reconciliation , the quaker librarian breathed .
8668 !!! — There can be no reconciliation , Stephen said , if there has not been a sundering .
8672 !!! — A child , a girl , placed in his arms , Marina . — The leaning of sophists towards the bypaths of apocrypha is a constant quantity , John Eglinton detected .
8674 !!! Good Bacon : gone musty .
8676 !!! Cypherjugglers going the highroads .
8684 !!! Will we be there by candlelight ? — Mr Brandes accepts it , Stephen said , as the first play of the closing period .
8686 !!! What does Mr Sidney Lee , or Mr Simon Lazarus as some aver his name is , say of it ? — Marina , Stephen said , a child of storm , Miranda , a wonder , Perdita , that which was lost .
8689 !!! My dearest wife _ , Pericles says , _ was like this maid .
8691 !!! Will any man love the daughter if he has not loved the mother ? — The art of being a grandfather , Mr Best gan murmur .
8702 !!! — I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public .
8707 !!! The favoured rival is William Herbert , earl of Pembroke .
8712 !!! Dost love thy man ? — That may be too , Stephen said .
8713 !!! There ’s a saying of Goethe ’s which Mr Magee likes to quote .
8715 !!! Why does he send to one who is a _ buonaroba , _ a bay where all men ride , a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood , a lordling to woo for him ?
8730 !!! But those who are done to death in sleep can not know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come .
8733 !!! Ravisher and ravished , what he would but would not , go with him from Lucrece ’s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen ’s breast , bare , with its mole cinquespotted .
8740 !!! A ribald face , sullen as a dean ’s , Buck Mulligan came forward , then blithe in motley , towards the greeting of their smiles .
8753 !!! — Yes , indeed , the quaker librarian said .
8758 !!! Buck Mulligan thought , puzzled : — Shakespeare ?
8764 !!! Mr Best turned to him .
8765 !!! — Haines missed you , he said .
8770 !!! — I came through the museum , Buck Mulligan said .
8771 !!! Was he here ? — The bard ’s fellowcountrymen , John Eglinton answered , are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising .
8772 !!! I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin .
8773 !!! Vining held that the prince was a woman .
8775 !!! Judge Barton , I believe , is searching for some clues .
8776 !!! He swears ( His Highness not His Lordship ) by saint Patrick . — The most brilliant of all is that story of Wilde ’s , Mr Best said , lifting his brilliant notebook .
8779 !!! the quaker librarian asked .
8782 !!! W. H. : who am I ? — I mean , for Willie Hughes , Mr Best said , amending his gloss easily .
8783 !!! Of course it ’s all paradox , do n’t you know , Hughes and hews and hues , the colour , but it ’s so typical the way he works it out .
8800 !!! Jove , a cool ruttime send them .
8803 ::: A snake coils her , fang in ’s kiss .
8805 !!! the quaker librarian was asking .
8808 !!! Buck Mulligan ’s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile .
8817 !!! The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done .
8824 !!! The aunt is going to call on your unsubstantial father .
8833 !!! He wailed : — And we to be there , mavrone , and you to be unbeknownst sending us your conglomerations the way we to have our tongues out a yard long like the drouthy clerics do be fainting for a pussful .
8834 !!! Stephen laughed .
8835 !!! Quickly , warningfully Buck Mulligan bent down .
8836 !!! — The tramper Synge is looking for you , he said , to murder you .
8840 !!! Stephen exclaimed .
8842 !!! Buck Mulligan gleefully bent back , laughing to the dark eavesdropping ceiling .
8854 !!! — Mr Lyster , an attendant said from the door ajar .
8856 !!! So Mr Justice Madden in his _ Diary of Master William Silence _ has found the hunting terms ...
8858 !!! What is it ? — There ’s a gentleman here , sir , the attendant said , coming forward and offering a card .
8862 !!! Is the gentleman ? ...
8875 !!! A patient silhouette waited , listening . — All the leading provincial ... _ Northern Whig , Cork Examiner , Enniscorthy Guardian , _ 1903 ...
8877 !!! Evans , conduct this gentleman ...
8884 !!! Buck Mulligan cried .
8889 !!! He rattled on : — Jehovah , collector of prepuces , is no more .
8904 !!! — We want to hear more , John Eglinton decided with Mr Best ’s approval .
8907 !!! — Antisthenes , pupil of Gorgias , Stephen said , took the palm of beauty from Kyrios Menelaus ’ brooddam , Argive Helen , the wooden mare of Troy in whom a score of heroes slept , and handed it to poor Penelope .
8910 !!! His art , more than the art of feudalism as Walt Whitman called it , is the art of surfeit .
8912 !!! Sir Walter Raleigh , when they arrested him , had half a million francs on his back including a pair of fancy stays .
8913 !!! The gombeenwoman Eliza Tudor had underlinen enough to vie with her of Sheba .
8915 !!! You know Manningham ’s story of the burgher ’s wife who bade Dick Burbage to her bed after she had seen him in _ Richard III _ and how Shakespeare , overhearing , without more ado about nothing , took the cow by the horns and , when Burbage came knocking at the gate , answered from the capon ’s blankets : _ William the conqueror came before Richard III _ .
8918 !!! _ Encore vingt sous .
8923 !!! Buck Mulligan , his pious eyes upturned , prayed : — Blessed Margaret Mary Anycock ! —
8926 !!! But all those twenty years what do you suppose poor Penelope in Stratford was doing behind the diamond panes ? Do and do .
8930 !!! Lids of Juno ’s eyes , violets .
8937 !!! Buck Mulligan rapped John Eglinton ’s desk sharply .
8944 !!! — As an Englishman , you mean , John sturdy Eglinton put in , he loved a lord .
8945 ::: Old wall where sudden lizards flash .
8947 !!! — It seems so , Stephen said , when he wants to do for him , and for all other and singular uneared wombs , the holy office an ostler does for the stallion .
8953 !!! Stephen turned boldly in his chair .
8956 !!! All those women saw their men down and under : Mary , her goodman John , Ann , her poor dear Willun , when he went and died on her , raging that he was the first to go , Joan , her four brothers , Judith , her husband and all her sons , Susan , her husband too , while Susan ’s daughter , Elizabeth , to use granddaddy ’s words , we d her second , having killed her first .
8965 !!! His legal knowledge was great Our judges tell us .
8972 !!! Woa ! — Pretty countryfolk had few chattels then , John Eglinton observed , as they have still if our peasant plays are true to type .
8973 !!! — He was a rich country gentleman , Stephen said , with a coat of arms and landed estate at Stratford and a house in Ireland yard , a capitalist shareholder , a bill promoter , a tithefarmer .
8974 !!! Why did he not leave her his best bed if he wished her to snore away the rest of her nights in peace ? — It is clear that there were two beds , a best and a secondbest , Mr Secondbest Best said finely .
8977 !!! — Antiquity mentions famous beds , Second Eglinton puckered , bedsmiling .
8979 !!! — Antiquity mentions that Stagyrite schoolurchin and bald heathen sage , Stephen said , who when dying in exile frees and endows his slaves , pays tribute to his elders , wills to be laid in earth near the bones of his dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress ( do n’t forget Nell Gwynn Herpyllis ) and let her live in his villa .
8981 !!! Mr Best asked with slight concern .
8982 !!! I mean ... — He died dead drunk , Buck Mulligan capped .
8984 !!! O , I must tell you what Dowden said ! — What ? asked Besteglinton .
8985 !!! William Shakespeare and company , limited .
8988 !!! Buck Mulligan suspired amorously .
8995 !!! Steadfast John replied severe : — The doctor can tell us what those words mean .
8998 !!! Will they wrest from us , from me , the palm of beauty ? — And the sense of property , Stephen said .
9000 !!! The son of a maltjobber and moneylender he was himself a cornjobber and moneylender , with ten tods of corn hoarded in the famine riots .
9001 !!! His borrowers are no doubt those divers of worship mentioned by Chettle Falstaff who reported his uprightness of dealing .
9003 !!! How else could Aubrey ’s ostler and callboy get rich quick ?
9005 !!! Shylock chimes with the jewbaiting that followed the hanging and quartering of the queen ’s leech Lopez , his jew ’s heart being plucked forth while the sheeny was yet alive : _ Hamlet _ and _ Macbeth _ with the coming to the throne of a Scotch philosophaster with a turn for witchroasting .
9011 !!! The sugared sonnets follow Sidney ’s .
9017 !!! Mingo , minxi , mictum , mingere . _ — Prove that he was a jew , John Eglinton dared , expectantly .
9018 !!! Your dean of studies holds he was a holy Roman .
9020 !!! _ — He was made in Germany , Stephen replied , as the champion French polisher of Italian scandals .
9021 !!! — A myriadminded man , Mr Best reminded .
9022 !!! Coleridge called him myriadminded .
9025 !!! In societate humana hoc est maxime necessarium ut sit amicitia inter multos . _ — Saint Thomas , Stephen began ... — _
9026 !!! Ora pro nobis _ , Monk Mulligan groaned , sinking to a chair .
9031 !!! — Saint Thomas , Stephen smiling said , whose gorbellied works I enjoy reading in the original , writing of incest from a standpoint different from that of the new Viennese school Mr Magee spoke of , likens it in his wise and curious way to an avarice of the emotions .
9033 !!! Jews , whom christians tax with avarice , are of all races the most given to intermarriage .
9037 !!! But a man who holds so tightly to what he calls his rights over what he calls his debts will hold tightly also to what he calls his rights over her whom he calls his wife .
9038 !!! No sir smile neighbour shall covet his ox or his wife or his manservant or his maidservant or his jackass .
9039 !!! — Or his jennyass , Buck Mulligan antiphoned .
9040 !!! — Gentle Will is being roughly handled , gentle Mr Best said gently . — Which will ? gagged sweetly Buck Mulligan .
9042 !!! — The will to live , John Eglinton philosophised , for poor Ann , Will ’s widow , is the will to die .
9044 !!! Stephen prayed .
9056 !!! But we have it on high authority that a man ’s worst enemies shall be those of his own house and family .
9057 !!! I feel that Russell is right .
9059 !!! I should say that only family poets have family lives .
9060 !!! Falstaff was not a family man .
9061 !!! I feel that the fat knight is his supreme creation .
9065 !!! A sire in Ultonian Antrim bade it him .
9067 !!! Mr Magee , sir , there ’s a gentleman to see you .
9076 !!! Dr Bob Kenny is attending her .
9079 !!! — A father , Stephen said , battling against hopelessness , is a necessary evil .
9081 !!! If you hold that he , a greying man with two marriageable daughters , with thirtyfive years of life , _ nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita _ , with fifty of experience , is the beardless undergraduate from Wittenberg then you must hold that his seventyyear old mother is the lustful queen .
9086 !!! Boccaccio ’s Calandrino was the first and last man who felt himself with child .
9087 !!! Fatherhood , in the sense of conscious begetting , is unknown to man .
9094 !!! Who is the father of any son that any son should love him or he any son ?
9106 !!! Sons with mothers , sires with daughters , lesbic sisters , loves that dare not speak their name , nephews with grandmothers , jailbirds with keyholes , queens with prize bulls .
9115 !!! — Sabellius , the African , subtlest heresiarch of all the beasts of the field , held that the Father was Himself His Own Son .

13094 !!! — Paddy ? says Alf . — Ay , says Joe .
13095 !!! He paid the debt of nature , God be merciful to him .
13096 !!! — Good Christ ! says
13104 !!! Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power .
13117 !!! — There he is again , says the citizen , staring out .
13120 !!! And , begob , I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again .
13123 !!! — Good Christ ! says he .
13125 !!! And says Bob Doran , with the hat on the back of his poll , lowest blackguard in Dublin when he ’s under the influence : — Who said Christ is good ? — I beg your parsnips , says Alf . — Is that a good Christ , says Bob Doran , to take away poor little Willy Dignam ? — Ah , well , says Alf , trying to pass it off .
13127 !!! But Bob Doran shouts out of him .
13129 !!! Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet , that they did n’t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises .
13130 !!! And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam , true as you ’re there .
13131 !!! — The finest man , says he , snivelling , the finest purest character .
13134 !!! Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married , Mooney , the bumbailiff ’s daughter , mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street , that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her , exposing her person , open to all comers , fair field and no favour .
13138 !!! Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door .
13139 !!! — Come in , come on , he wo n’t eat you , says the citizen .
13140 !!! So Bloom slopes in with his cod ’s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there .
13141 !!! — O , Christ M’Keown , says Joe , reading one of the letters .
13147 !!! private Arthur Chace for fowl murder of Jessie Tilsit in Pentonville prison and i was assistant when ... _ — Jesus , says I. — _ ...
13148 !!! Billington executed the awful murderer Toad Smith ... _
13149 !!! The citizen made a grab at the letter .
13150 !!! — Hold hard , says Joe , _
13152 !!! _ H. Rumbold , Master Barber . _ — And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too , says the citizen . — And the dirty scrawl of the wretch , says Joe .
13154 !!! So they started arguing about the point , Bloom saying he would n’t and he could n’t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he ’d just take a cigar .
13156 !!! — Give us one of your prime stinkers , Terry , says Joe .
13157 !!! And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it .
13163 !!! So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I ’m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I do n’t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on .
13164 !!! — There ’s one thing it has n’t a deterrent effect on , says Alf . — What ’s that ?
13165 !!! says Joe . — The poor bugger ’s tool that ’s being hanged , says Alf . — That so ? says Joe . — God ’s truth , says Alf .
13168 !!! — Ruling passion strong in death , says Joe , as someone said .
13169 !!! — That can be explained by science , says Bloom .
13172 !!! The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would , according to the best approved tradition of medical science , be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus , thereby causing the elastic pores of the _ corpora cavernosa _ to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection _ in articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis .
13174 !!! So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged , drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this , that and the other .
13178 !!! So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him : — Give us the paw !
13182 !!! Give us the paw ! Arrah , bloody end to the paw he ’d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog : give you the bloody pip .
13186 !!! And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point , the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country , the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she ’s far from the land .
13190 !!! Time they were stopping up in the _ City Arms _ pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk .
13191 !!! And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and , by the holy farmer , he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings , if the three women did n’t near roast him , it ’s a queer story , the old one , Bloom ’s wife and Mrs O’Dowd that kept the hotel .
13193 !!! And Bloom with his _ but do n’t you see ? _ and _
13195 !!! And sure , more be token , the lout I ’m told was in Power ’s after , the blender ’s , round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment .
13196 !!! Phenomenon ! — The memory of the dead , says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom . — Ay , ay , says Joe . — You do n’t grasp my point , says Bloom .
13201 !!! The friends we love are by our side and the foes we hate before us .
13209 !!! Our two inimitable drolls did a roaring trade with their broadsheets among lovers of the comedy element and nobody who has a corner in his heart for real Irish fun without vulgarity will grudge them their hardearned pennies .
13210 !!! The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day ’s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat .
13213 !!! All the delegates without exception expressed themselves in the strongest possible heterogeneous terms concerning the nameless barbarity which they had been called upon to witness .
13216 !!! The baby policeman , Constable MacFadden , summoned by special courier from Booterstown , quickly restored order and with lightning promptitude proposed the seventeenth of the month as a solution equally honourable for both contending parties .
13221 !!! Quietly , unassumingly Rumbold stepped on to the scaffold in faultless morning dress and wearing his favourite flower , the _ Gladiolus Cruentus _ .
13223 !!! The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse , the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries , _ hoch , banzai , eljen , zivio , chinchin , polla kronia , hiphip , vive , Allah _ , amid which the ringing _ evviva _ of the delegate of the land of song ( a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers ) was easily distinguishable .
13226 !!! The learned prelate who administered the last comforts of holy religion to the hero martyr when about to pay the death penalty knelt in a most christian spirit in a pool of rainwater , his cassock above his hoary head , and offered up to the throne of grace fervent prayers of supplication .
13233 !!! The _ nec _ and _ non plus ultra _ of emotion were reached when the blushing bride elect burst her way through the serried ranks of the bystanders and flung herself upon the muscular bosom of him who was about to be launched into eternity for her sake .
13234 !!! The hero folded her willowy form in a loving embrace murmuring fondly _ Sheila , my own _ .
13241 !!! Big strong men , officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary , were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage .
13242 !!! A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate , noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex , stepped forward and , presenting his visiting card , bankbook and genealogical tree , solicited the hand of the hapless young lady , requesting her to name the day , and was accepted on the spot .
13243 !!! Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch , a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion : and when the gallant young Oxonian ( the bearer , by the way , of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion ’s history ) placed on the finger of his blushing _ fiancée _
13245 !!! Nay , even the stern provostmarshal , lieutenantcolonel Tomkin - Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson , who presided on the sad occasion , he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching , could not now restrain his natural emotion .
13246 !!! With his mailed gauntlet he brushed away a furtive tear and was overheard , by those privileged burghers who happened to be in his immediate _ entourage , _ to murmur to himself in a faltering undertone : — God blimey if she ai nt a clinker , that there bleeding tart .
13248 !!! So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that ca n’t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink , the curse of Ireland .
13250 !!! Gob , he ’d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you ’d ever see the froth of his pint .
13254 ::: And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of .
13255 ::: And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females , hitting below the belt .
13256 ::: So howandever , as I was saying , the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me .
13259 !!! — Afraid he ’ll bite you ? says the citizen , jeering .
13263 !!! — What ’s on you , Garry ? says he .
13268 !!! All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals ( and their name is legion ) should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the _ sobriquet _ of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry .
13270 !!! Our greatest living phonetic expert ( wild horses shall not drag it from us ! ) has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a _ striking _ resemblance ( the italics are ours ) to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards .
13271 !!! We are not speaking so much of those delightful lovesongs with which the writer who conceals his identity under the graceful pseudonym of the Little Sweet Branch has familiarised the bookloving world but rather ( as a contributor D. O. C. points out in an interesting communication published by an evening contemporary ) of the harsher and more personal note which is found in the satirical effusions of the famous Raftery and of Donal MacConsidine to say nothing of a more modern lyrist at present very much in the public eye .
13272 !!! We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication .
13273 !!! The metrical system of the canine original , which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn , is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught .
13277 !!! And Joe asked him would he have another .
13282 !!! And says Joe : — Could you make a hole in another pint ? — Could a swim duck ? says I. — Same again , Terry , says Joe .
13285 !!! — Thank you , no , says Bloom .
13287 !!! Martin asked me to go to the house .
13288 !!! You see , he , Dignam , I mean , did n’t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee ca n’t recover on the policy . — Holy Wars , says Joe , laughing , that ’s a good one if old Shylock is landed .
13289 !!! So the wife comes out top dog , what ? —
13290 !!! Well , that ’s a point , says Bloom , for the wife ’s admirers .
13291 !!! — Whose admirers ? says Joe . — The wife ’s advisers , I mean , says Bloom .
13292 !!! Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee ’s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act .
13298 !!! So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer , a finer than poor little Willy that ’s dead to tell her .
13309 !!! Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby , 14A. Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time , fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard , drinking porter out of teacups .
13316 !!! Only Paddy was passing there , I tell you what .
13320 !!! Gob , Jack made him toe the line .
13322 !!! So Terry brought the three pints .
13323 !!! — Here , says Joe , doing the honours .
13325 !!! — Fortune , Joe , says I. Good health , citizen .
13328 !!! — Who is the long fellow running for the mayoralty , Alf ? says Joe . — Friend of yours , says Alf . — Nannan ? says Joe .
13329 !!! The mimber ? — I wo n’t mention any names , says Alf . — I thought so , says Joe .
13331 !!! — Hairy Iopas , says the citizen , that exploded volcano , the darling of all countries and the idol of his own .
13332 !!! So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue .
13334 !!! Walking about with his book and pencil here ’s my head and my heels are coming till Joe Cuffe gave him the order of the boot for giving lip to a grazier .
13337 !!! Pisser Burke was telling me in the hotel the wife used to be in rivers of tears some times with Mrs O’Dowd crying her eyes out with her eight inches of fat all over her .
13342 ::: Because the poor animals suffer and experts say and the best known remedy that does n’t cause pain to the animal and on the sore spot administer gently .
13351 !!! Then comes good uncle Leo .
13357 !!! — Anyhow , says Joe , Field and Nannetti are going over tonight to London to ask about it on the floor of the house of commons .
13358 !!! — Are you sure , says Bloom , the councillor is going ?
13360 !!! — Well , he ’s going off by the mailboat , says Joe , tonight .
13361 !!! — That ’s too bad , says Bloom .
13363 !!! Perhaps only Mr Field is going .
13366 !!! You ’re sure ? — Nannan ’s going too , says Joe .
13376 !!! Honourable members are already in possession of the evidence produced before a committee of the whole house .
13382 !!! Mr Cowe Conacre : Has the right honourable gentleman ’s famous Mitchelstown telegram inspired the policy of gentlemen on the Treasury bench ?
13389 !!! ( The house rises .
13390 !!! Cheers . ) — There ’s the man , says Joe , that made the Gaelic sports revival .
13394 !!! What was your best throw , citizen ? — _
13395 !!! Na bacleis _ , says the citizen , letting on to be modest .
13397 !!! — Put it there , citizen , says Joe .
13400 !!! says Alf . — Yes , says Bloom .
13404 !!! And of course Bloom had to have his say too about if a fellow had a rower ’s heart violent exercise was bad .
13410 !!! The venerable president of the noble order was in the chair and the attendance was of large dimensions .
13413 !!! L. Bloom , who met with a mixed reception of applause and hisses , having espoused the negative the vocalist chairman brought the discussion to a close , in response to repeated requests and hearty plaudits from all parts of a bumper house , by a remarkably noteworthy rendering of the immortal Thomas Osborne Davis ’ evergreen verses ( happily too familiar to need recalling here ) _
13415 !!! The Irish Caruso - Garibaldi was in superlative form and his stentorian notes were heard to the greatest advantage in the timehonoured anthem sung as only our citizen can sing it .
13443 !!! The laity included P. Fay , T. Quirke , etc . , etc . — Talking about violent exercise , says Alf , were you at that Keogh - Bennett match ? — No , says Joe . — I heard So and So made a cool hundred quid over it , says Alf . — Who ?
13444 !!! Blazes ? says Joe .
13445 !!! And says Bloom : — What I meant about tennis , for example , is the agility and training the eye .
13446 !!! — Ay , Blazes , says Alf .
13447 !!! He let out that Myler was on the beer to run up the odds and he swatting all the time .
13448 !!! — We know him , says the citizen .
13451 !!! — True for you , says Joe . And Bloom cuts in again about lawn tennis and the circulation of the blood , asking Alf : — Now , do n’t you think , Bergan ? — Myler dusted the floor with him , says Alf .
13452 !!! Heenan and Sayers was only a bloody fool to it .
13457 ::: Handicapped as he was by lack of poundage , Dublin ’s pet lamb made up for it by superlative skill in ringcraft .
13459 !!! The welterweight sergeantmajor had tapped some lively claret in the previous mixup during which Keogh had been receivergeneral of rights and lefts , the artilleryman putting in some neat work on the pet ’s nose , and Myler came on looking groggy .
13460 !!! The soldier got to business , leading off with a powerful left jab to which the Irish gladiator retaliated by shooting out a stiff one flush to the point of Bennett ’s jaw .
13461 !!! The redcoat ducked but the Dubliner lifted him with a left hook , the body punch being a fine one .
13462 !!! The men came to handigrips .
13463 !!! Myler quickly became busy and got his man under , the bout ending with the bulkier man on the ropes , Myler punishing him .
13464 !!! The Englishman , whose right eye was nearly closed , took his corner where he was liberally drenched with water and when the bell went came on gamey and brimful of pluck , confident of knocking out the fistic Eblanite in jigtime .
13467 !!! The referee twice cautioned Pucking Percy for holding but the pet was tricky and his footwork a treat to watch .
13468 ::: After a brisk exchange of courtesies during which a smart upper cut of the military man brought blood freely from his opponent ’s mouth the lamb suddenly waded in all over his man and landed a terrific left to Battling Bennett ’s stomach , flooring him flat .
13470 !!! Amid tense expectation the Portobello bruiser was being counted out when Bennett ’s second Ole Pfotts Wettstein threw in the towel and the Santry boy was declared victor to the frenzied cheers of the public who broke through the ringropes and fairly mobbed him with delight .
13471 !!! — He knows which side his bread is buttered , says Alf .
13473 !!! — He is , says Joe .
13474 !!! Is n’t he ? — Who ? says Bloom .
13479 !!! — Mrs B. is the bright particular star , is n’t she ?
13480 !!! says Joe . — My wife ?
13481 !!! says Bloom .
13486 !!! Hoho begob says I to myself says I.
13501 !!! The chaste spouse of Leopold is she : Marion of the bountiful bosoms .
13502 !!! And lo , there entered one of the clan of the O’Molloy ’s , a comely hero of white face yet withal somewhat ruddy , his majesty ’s counsel learned in the law , and with him the prince and heir of the noble line of Lambert . — Hello , Ned . — Hello , Alf . — Hello , Jack . — Hello , Joe . — God save you , says the citizen .
13503 !!! — Save you kindly , says J. J.
13504 !!! What ’ll it be , Ned ? — Half one , says Ned .
13505 !!! So J. J. ordered the drinks .
13507 !!! says Joe .
13509 !!! Yes , says J. J. He ’ll square that , Ned , says he .
13510 !!! — Hope so , says Ned .
13516 !!! Pawning his gold watch in Cummins of Francis street where no - one would know him in the private office when I was there with Pisser releasing his boots out of the pop .
13517 !!! What ’s your name , sir ? Dunne , says he .
13518 !!! Ay , and done says I. Gob , he ’ll come home by weeping cross one of those days , I ’m thinking .
13520 !!! says Alf . U. p : up .
13522 !!! — Ay , says Ned .
13523 !!! And he wanted right go wrong to address the court only Corny Kelleher got round him telling him to get the handwriting examined first .
13524 !!! — Ten thousand pounds , says Alf , laughing .
13526 !!! — Was it you did it , Alf ? says Joe .
13528 !!! — Me ? says Alf . Do n’t cast your nasturtiums on my character .
13529 !!! — Whatever statement you make , says Joe , will be taken down in evidence against you .
13530 !!! — Of course an action would lie , says J. J.
13533 !!! _ — Compos _ your eye ! says Alf , laughing .
13537 !!! — Yes , says J. J. , but the truth of a libel is no defence to an indictment for publishing it in the eyes of the law .
13538 !!! — Ha ha , Alf , says Joe . — Still , says Bloom , on account of the poor woman , I mean his wife .
13539 !!! — Pity about her , says the citizen .
13540 !!! Or any other woman marries a half and half . — How half and half ?
13541 !!! says Bloom .
13542 !!! Do you mean he ... — Half and half I mean , says the citizen .
13543 !!! A fellow that ’s neither fish nor flesh . — Nor good red herring , says Joe . — That what ’s I mean , says the citizen .
13546 !!! And Bloom explaining he meant on account of it being cruel for the wife having to go round after the old stuttering fool .
13547 !!! Cruelty to animals so it is to let that bloody povertystricken Breen out on grass with his beard out tripping him , bringing down the rain .
13548 !!! And she with her nose cockahoop after she married him because a cousin of his old fellow ’s was pewopener to the pope .
13549 !!! Picture of him on the wall with his Smashall Sweeney ’s moustaches , the signior Brini from Summerhill , the eyetallyano , papal Zouave to the Holy Father , has left the quay and gone to Moss street .
13552 !!! — And moreover , says J. J. , a postcard is publication .
13559 !!! — Well , good health , Jack , says Ned . — Good health , Ned , says J. J. — -There he is again , says Joe . — Where ? says Alf . And begob there he was passing the door with his books under his oxter and the wife beside him and Corny Kelleher with his wall eye looking in as they went past , talking to him like a father , trying to sell him a secondhand coffin .
13561 !!! says Joe . — Remanded , says J. J. One of the bottlenosed fraternity it was went by the name of James Wought alias Saphiro alias Spark and Spiro , put an ad in the papers saying he ’d give a passage to Canada for twenty bob .
13566 !!! J. J. was telling us there was an ancient Hebrew Zaretsky or something weeping in the witnessbox with his hat on him , swearing by the holy Moses he was stuck for two quid .
13568 !!! says Joe . — Recorder , says Ned . — Poor old sir Frederick , says Alf , you can cod him up to the two eyes .
13569 !!! — Heart as big as a lion , says Ned .
13571 !!! — Ay , says Alf .
13572 !!! Reuben J was bloody lucky he did n’t clap him in the dock the other day for suing poor little Gumley that ’s minding stones , for the corporation there near Butt bridge .
13577 !!! And my wife has the typhoid .
13585 !!! And whereas on the sixteenth day of the month of the oxeyed goddess and in the third week after the feastday of the Holy and Undivided Trinity , the daughter of the skies , the virgin moon being then in her first quarter , it came to pass that those learned judges repaired them to the halls of law .
13586 !!! There master Courtenay , sitting in his own chamber , gave his rede and master Justice Andrews , sitting without a jury in the probate court , weighed well and pondered the claim of the first chargeant upon the property in the matter of the will propounded and final testamentary disposition _ in re _ the real and personal estate of the late lamented Jacob Halliday , vintner , deceased , versus Livingstone , an infant , of unsound mind , and another .
13592 !!! And straightway the minions of the law led forth from their donjon keep one whom the sleuthhounds of justice had apprehended in consequence of information received .
13594 !!! — Those are nice things , says the citizen , coming over here to Ireland filling the country with bugs .
13596 !!! And so Joe swore high and holy by this and by that he ’d do the devil and all .
13597 !!! — Because , you see , says Bloom , for an advertisement you must have repetition .
13598 !!! That ’s the whole secret . — Rely on me , says Joe . — Swindling the peasants , says the citizen , and the poor of Ireland .
13600 !!! — O , I ’m sure that will be all right , Hynes , says Bloom .
13602 !!! — Consider that done , says Joe . — Very kind of you , says Bloom . — The strangers , says the citizen .
13606 !!! The adulteress and her paramour brought the Saxon robbers here .
13607 !!! — Decree _ nisi , _ says J. J. And Bloom letting on to be awfully deeply interested in nothing , a spider ’s web in the corner behind the barrel , and the citizen scowling after him and the old dog at his feet looking up to know who to bite and when .
13608 !!! — A dishonoured wife , says the citizen , that ’s what ’s the cause of all our misfortunes .
13609 !!! — And here she is , says Alf , that was giggling over the _ Police Gazette _ with Terry on the counter , in all her warpaint .
13611 !!! And what was it only one of the smutty yankee pictures Terry borrows off of Corny Kelleher .
13614 !!! Norman W. Tupper , wealthy Chicago contractor , finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor .
13615 !!! Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself , and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W. Tupper bouncing in with his peashooter just in time to be late after she doing the trick of the loop with officer Taylor . — O jakers , Jenny , says Joe , how short your shirt is !
13617 !!! So anyhow in came John Wyse Nolan and Lenehan with him with a face on him as long as a late breakfast .
13618 !!! — Well , says the citizen , what ’s the latest from the scene of action ?
13619 !!! What did those tinkers in the city hall at their caucus meeting decide about the Irish language ? O’Nolan , clad in shining armour , low bending made obeisance to the puissant and high and mighty chief of all Erin and did him to wit of that which had befallen , how that the grave elders of the most obedient city , second of the realm , had met them in the tholsel , and there , after due prayers to the gods who dwell in ether supernal , had taken solemn counsel whereby they might , if so be it might be , bring once more into honour among mortal men the winged speech of the seadivided Gael .
13620 !!! — It ’s on the march , says the citizen .
13622 !!! So J. J. puts in a word , doing the toff about one story was good till you heard another and blinking facts and the Nelson policy , putting your blind eye to the telescope and drawing up a bill of attainder to impeach a nation , and Bloom trying to back him up moderation and botheration and their colonies and their civilisation .
13623 !!! — Their syphilisation , you mean , says the citizen .
13629 !!! — The European family , says J. J .... — They ’re not European , says the citizen .
13633 !!! And says John Wyse : — Full many a flower is born to blush unseen .
13634 !!! And says Lenehan that knows a bit of the lingo : — _ Conspuez les Anglais !

13665 !!! Where are the Greek merchants that came through the pillars of Hercules , the Gibraltar now grabbed by the foe of mankind , with gold and Tyrian purple to sell in Wexford at the fair of Carmen ?

13669 !!! And the beds of the Barrow and Shannon they wo n’t deepen with millions of acres of marsh and bog to make us all die of consumption ? — As treeless as Portugal we ’ll be soon , says John Wyse , or Heligoland with its one tree if something is not done to reafforest the land . Larches , firs , all the trees of the conifer family are going fast .
13670 !!! I was reading a report of lord Castletown ’s ... — Save them , says the citizen , the giant ash of Galway and the chieftain elm of Kildare with a fortyfoot bole and an acre of foliage .

13691 ::: Cows in Connacht have long horns .
13692 !!! As much as his bloody life is worth to go down and address his tall talk to the assembled multitude in Shanagolden where he dare n’t show his nose with the Molly Maguires looking for him to let daylight through him for grabbing the holding of an evicted tenant . — Hear , hear to that , says John Wyse .
13693 !!! What will you have ? — An imperial yeomanry , says Lenehan , to celebrate the occasion .
13694 !!! — Half one , Terry , says John Wyse , and a hands up .
13696 !!! Are you asleep ? — Yes , sir , says Terry .
13699 !!! Hanging over the bloody paper with Alf looking for spicy bits instead of attending to the general public .

13708 !!! A fellow writes that calls himself _ Disgusted One _ .
13710 ::: — A rump and dozen , says the citizen , was what that old ruffian sir John Beresford called it but the modern God ’s Englishman calls it caning on the breech .

13735 !!! But my point was ... — We are a long time waiting for that day , citizen , says Ned .
13736 !!! Since the poor old woman told us that the French were on the sea and landed at Killala .
13737 !!! — Ay , says John Wyse .
13744 !!! says the citizen .
13751 !!! _ Conspuez les Français _ , says Lenehan , nobbling his beer .
13752 !!! — And as for the Prooshians and the Hanoverians , says Joe , have n’t we had enough of those sausageeating bastards on the throne from George the elector down to the German lad and the flatulent old bitch that ’s dead ? Jesus , I had to laugh at the way he came out with that about the old one with the winkers on her , blind drunk in her royal palace every night of God , old Vic , with her jorum of mountain dew and her coachman carting her up body and bones to roll into bed and she pulling him by the whiskers and singing him old bits of songs about _
13753 !!! Ehren on the Rhine _ and come where the boose is cheaper . — Well , says J. J.
13755 !!! — Tell that to a fool , says the citizen .
13758 !!! And what do you think , says Joe , of the holy boys , the priests and bishops of Ireland doing up his room in Maynooth in His Satanic Majesty ’s racing colours and sticking up pictures of all the horses his jockeys rode .
13760 !!! — They ought to have stuck up all the women he rode himself , says little Alf . And says J. J. : — Considerations of space influenced their lordships ’ decision .
13761 !!! — Will you try another , citizen ? says Joe . —

13771 !!! Yes , says Bloom . — What is it ?
13772 !!! says John Wyse . — A nation ?

13775 !!! — By God , then , says Ned , laughing , if that ’s so I ’m a nation for I ’m living in the same place for the past five years .
13777 !!! — That covers my case , says Joe . — What is your nation if I may ask ?
13778 !!! says the citizen . — Ireland , says Bloom .
13781 !!! The citizen said nothing only cleared the spit out of his gullet and , gob , he spat a Red bank oyster out of him right in the corner .
13783 !!! — Here you are , citizen , says Joe .
13787 !!! The scenes depicted on the emunctory field , showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones , are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides .
13789 !!! — Show us over the drink , says I. Which is which ? — That ’s mine , says Joe , as the devil said to the dead policeman .
13790 !!! — And I belong to a race too , says Bloom , that is hated and persecuted .
13802 !!! says the citizen .
13803 !!! — I ’m talking about injustice , says Bloom . — Right , says John Wyse .
13814 !!! — What ? says Alf . — Love , says Bloom .
13817 !!! Just round to the court a moment to see if Martin is there .
13822 !!! — A new apostle to the gentiles , says the citizen .

13840 !!! His Majesty the King loves Her Majesty the Queen .
13841 !!! Mrs Norman W. Tupper loves officer Taylor .
13843 !!! And this person loves that other person because everybody loves somebody but God loves everybody .
13845 !!! More power , citizen . — Hurrah , there , says Joe . — The blessing of God and Mary and Patrick on you , says the citizen .
13849 !!! God is love _ pasted round the mouth of his cannon ?
13852 !!! says Joe .
13853 !!! So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out : — A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting , Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs , to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions .
13854 !!! The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate , in the course of a happy speech , freely translated by the British chaplain , the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones , tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire , stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible , the volume of the word of God and the secret of England ’s greatness , graciously presented to him by the white chief woman , the great squaw Victoria , with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor .
13855 !!! The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast _ Black and White _ from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak , surnamed Forty Warts , after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors ’ book , subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance , in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks , amid hilarious applause from the girl hands .
13856 !!! — Widow woman , says Ned .
13859 !!! — Same only more so , says Lenehan .
13861 !!! — Is that by Griffith ? says John Wyse . — No , says the citizen .
13863 !!! It ’s only initialled : P. — And a very good initial too , says Joe . — That ’s how it ’s worked , says the citizen .
13864 !!! Trade follows the flag .
13865 !!! — Well , says J. J. , if they ’re any worse than those Belgians in the Congo Free State they must be bad .
13866 !!! Did you read that report by a man what ’s this his name is ? — Casement , says the citizen .
13868 !!! — Yes , that ’s the man , says J. J. Raping the women and girls and flogging the natives on the belly to squeeze all the red rubber they can out of them .
13869 !!! — I know where he ’s gone , says Lenehan , cracking his fingers .
13875 !!! says the citizen , that never backed a horse in anger in his life ? — That ’s where he ’s gone , says Lenehan .
13878 !!! He ’s the only man in Dublin has it .
13880 !!! — He ’s a bloody dark horse himself , says Joe . — Mind , Joe , says I. Show us the entrance out .
13881 !!! — There you are , says Terry .
13889 !!! phthook ! ) never be up to those bloody ( there ’s the last of it )
13891 !!! So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong , John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering , packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries .
13895 !!! God save Ireland from the likes of that bloody mouseabout .
13903 !!! — Well , it ’s a fact , says John Wyse .
13905 !!! Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton , pensioner out of the collector general ’s , an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king ’s expense .
13906 !!! Our travellers reached the rustic hostelry and alighted from their palfreys .
13911 !!! Mine host came forth at the summons , girding him with his tabard .
13917 !!! — Lackaday , good masters , said the host , my poor house has but a bare larder .
13925 !!! The king ’s friends ( God bless His Majesty ! ) shall not go afasting in my house I warrant me .
13929 !!! Mine host bowed again as he made answer : — What say you , good masters , to a squab pigeon pasty , some collops of venison , a saddle of veal , widgeon with crisp hog ’s bacon , a boar ’s head with pistachios , a bason of jolly custard , a medlar tansy and a flagon of old Rhenish ? — Gadzooks !
13932 !!! Pistachios ! — Aha ! cried he of the pleasant countenance .
13934 !!! So in comes Martin asking where was Bloom . — Where is he ?
13935 !!! says Lenehan .
13937 !!! — Is n’t that a fact , says John Wyse , what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein ? — That ’s so , says Martin .
13940 !!! says Alf . — I , says Joe .
13942 !!! — And after all , says John Wyse , why ca n’t a jew love his country like the next fellow ? — Why not ? says J. J. , when he ’s quite sure which country it is .
13943 !!! — Is he a jew or a gentile or a holy Roman or a swaddler or what the hell is he ? says Ned .
13946 !!! — Who is Junius ?
13947 !!! says J. J. — We do n’t want him , says Crofter the Orangeman or presbyterian .
13948 !!! — He ’s a perverted jew , says Martin , from a place in Hungary and it was he drew up all the plans according to the Hungarian system .
13951 !!! says Jack Power .
13952 !!! — Not at all , says Martin .
13955 !!! He changed it by deedpoll , the father did .
13957 !!! says the citizen .
13959 !!! — Well , they ’re still waiting for their redeemer , says Martin .
13961 !!! — Yes , says J. J. , and every male that ’s born they think it may be their Messiah .
13962 !!! And every jew is in a tall state of excitement , I believe , till he knows if he ’s a father or a mother .
13963 !!! — Expecting every moment will be his next , says Lenehan . — O , by God , says Ned , you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born .
13966 !!! En ventre sa mère _ , says J. J. — Do you call that a man ?
13967 !!! says the citizen .
13968 !!! — I wonder did he ever put it out of sight , says Joe .
13969 !!! — Well , there were two children born anyhow , says Jack Power .
13971 !!! says the citizen .
13980 !!! Not as much as would blind your eye . — Charity to the neighbour , says Martin .
13983 ::: — A wolf in sheep ’s clothing , says the citizen .
13988 !!! — Have you time for a brief libation , Martin ? says Ned . — Only one , says Martin .
13992 !!! Three half ones , Terry . — Saint Patrick would want to land again at Ballykinlar and convert us , says the citizen , after allowing things like that to contaminate our shores .
13993 !!! — Well , says Martin , rapping for his glass .
13994 !!! God bless all here is my prayer .
13995 !!! — Amen , says the citizen .
13996 !!! — And I ’m sure He will , says Joe .
13998 !!! And after came all saints and martyrs , virgins and confessors : S. Cyr and S. Isidore Arator and S. James the Less and S. Phocas of Sinope and S. Julian Hospitator and S. Felix de Cantalice and S. Simon Stylites and S. Stephen Protomartyr and S. John of God and S. Ferreol and S. Leugarde and S. Theodotus and S. Vulmar and S. Richard and S. Vincent de Paul and S.

14003 !!! And when the good fathers had reached the appointed place , the house of Bernard Kiernan and Co , limited , 8 , 9 and 10 little Britain street , wholesale grocers , wine and brandy shippers , licensed for the sale of beer , wine and spirits for consumption on the premises , the celebrant blessed the house and censed the mullioned windows and the groynes and the vaults and the arrises and the capitals and the pediments and the cornices and the engrailed arches and the spires and the cupolas and sprinkled the lintels thereof with blessed water and prayed that God might bless that house as he had blessed the house of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and make the angels of His light to inhabit therein .
14012 !!! Te auctore percipiat per Christum Dominum nostrum . _ — And so say all of us , says Jack . — Thousand a year , Lambert , says Crofton or Crawford .
14013 !!! — Right , says Ned , taking up his John Jameson .
14017 !!! I hope I ’m not ... — No , says Martin , we ’re ready .
14021 !!! Devil a sweet fear !
14025 !!! Hundred to five . — Do n’t tell anyone , says the citizen .
14026 !!! — Beg your pardon , says he . — Come on boys , says Martin , seeing it was looking blue .
14028 !!! — Do n’t tell anyone , says the citizen , letting a bawl out of him .
14030 ::: And the bloody dog woke up and let a growl .
14031 !!! — Bye bye all , says Martin .
14033 !!! — Off with you , says Martin to the jarvey .
14034 ::: The milkwhite dolphin tossed his mane and , rising in the golden poop the helmsman spread the bellying sail upon the wind and stood off forward with all sail set , the spinnaker to larboard .
14039 !!! But begob I was just lowering the heel of the pint when I saw the citizen getting up to waddle to the door , puffing and blowing with the dropsy , and he cursing the curse of Cromwell on him , bell , book and candle in Irish , spitting and spatting out of him and Joe and little Alf round him like a leprechaun trying to peacify him .
14042 !!! Arrah , sit down on the parliamentary side of your arse for Christ ’ sake and do n’t be making a public exhibition of yourself .
14045 !!! And all the ragamuffins and sluts of the nation round the door and Martin telling the jarvey to drive ahead and the citizen bawling and Alf and Joe at him to whisht and he on his high horse about the jews and the loafers calling for a speech and Jack Power trying to get him to sit down on the car and hold his bloody jaw and a loafer with a patch over his eye starts singing _
14046 !!! If the man in the moon was a jew , jew , jew _ and a slut shouts out of her : — Eh , mister !
14047 ::: Your fly is open , mister !
14048 !!! And says he : — Mendelssohn was a jew and Karl Marx and Mercadante and Spinoza .
14049 !!! And the Saviour was a jew and his father was a jew .
14050 !!! Your God . — He had no father , says Martin .
14053 !!! — Whose God ? says the citizen .
14054 !!! — Well , his uncle was a jew , says he .
14055 !!! Your God was a jew .
14056 !!! Christ was a jew like me .
14057 !!! Gob , the citizen made a plunge back into the shop .
14062 !!! Stop ! says Joe .
14066 !!! The departing guest was the recipient of a hearty ovation , many of those who were present being visibly moved when the select orchestra of Irish pipes struck up the wellknown strains of _ Come Back to Erin _ , followed immediately by _ Rakóczsy ’s March _ .
14072 !!! Gob , the devil would n’t stop him till he got hold of the bloody tin anyhow and out with him and little Alf hanging on to his elbow and he shouting like a stuck pig , as good as any bloody play in the Queen ’s royal theatre : — Where is he till I murder him ? And Ned and J. J. paralysed with the laughing .
14074 !!! But as luck would have it the jarvey got the nag ’s head round the other way and off with him .
14075 !!! — Hold on , citizen , says Joe . Stop ! Begob he drew his hand and made a swipe and let fly .
14078 !!! The bloody nag took fright and the old mongrel after the car like bloody hell and all the populace shouting and laughing and the old tinbox clattering along the street .
14085 !!! Other eyewitnesses depose that they observed an incandescent object of enormous proportions hurtling through the atmosphere at a terrifying velocity in a trajectory directed southwest by west .
14086 !!! Messages of condolence and sympathy are being hourly received from all parts of the different continents and the sovereign pontiff has been graciously pleased to decree that a special _ missa pro defunctis _ shall be celebrated simultaneously by the ordinaries of each and every cathedral church of all the episcopal dioceses subject to the spiritual authority of the Holy See in suffrage of the souls of those faithful departed who have been so unexpectedly called away from our midst .
14091 !!! The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses .
14114 !!! They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets , building castles as children do , or playing with their big coloured ball , happy as the day was long .
14115 !!! And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight .
14117 !!! Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin .
14118 !!! — Now , baby , Cissy Caffrey said .
14121 !!! And baby prattled after her : — A jink a jink a jawbo .
14122 !!! Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children , so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on .
14123 !!! What a persuasive power that girl had !
14124 !!! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold , a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib .
14126 !!! A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life , always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips , a girl lovable in the extreme .
14127 !!! And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother .
14129 !!! Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule .
14131 !!! But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and , true to the maxim that every little Irishman ’s house is his castle , he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and ( alas to relate ! )
14133 !!! Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends . — Come here , Tommy , his sister called imperatively .
14137 !!! His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister ’s word was law with the twins .
14139 !!! His little man - o’-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life ’s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit .
14145 !!! Is Cissy your sweetheart ? — Nao , tearful Tommy said .
14147 !!! Cissy queried .
14148 !!! — Nao , Tommy said .
14149 !!! — I know , Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes .
14151 !!! Gerty is Tommy ’s sweetheart .
14152 !!! — Nao , Tommy said on the verge of tears .
14153 !!! Cissy ’s quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman could n’t see and to mind he did n’t wet his new tan shoes .
14156 !!! Her figure was slight and graceful , inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch ’s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling .
14159 !!! Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman , a deliberate lie , when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty ( the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals ) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she ’d never speak to her again .
14165 !!! Why have women such eyes of witchery ? Gerty ’s were of the bluest Irish blue , set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows .
14180 !!! She knew right well , no - one better , what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers ’ quarrel .
14182 !!! Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university .
14183 !!! Little recked he perhaps for what she felt , that dull aching void in her heart sometimes , piercing to the core .
14185 !!! They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph .
14186 !!! But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked , every inch a gentleman , the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he did n’t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden .
14187 !!! Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out .
14193 !!! Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear ( Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very _ petite _
14196 !!! As for undies they were Gerty ’s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen ( though Gerty would never see seventeen again ) can find it in his heart to blame her ?
14199 !!! She was wearing the blue for luck , hoping against hope , her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers ’ meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it was n’t of a Friday .
14207 !!! Yes , she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. ( because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie ) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be .
14220 !!! And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be .
14222 !!! She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess .
14226 !!! Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done
14229 !!! But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there ’d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground , if you please .
14232 !!! Edy told him no , no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him .
14233 !!! — You ’re not my sister , naughty Tommy said .
14235 !!! But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up , look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career , having won the day .
14237 !!! And she tickled tiny tot ’s two cheeks to make him forget and played here ’s the lord mayor , here ’s his two horses , here ’s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in , chinchopper , chinchopper , chinchopper chin .
14238 !!! But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him .
14241 !!! Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she ’d be ashamed of her life to say , flushing a deep rosy red , and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said .
14257 !!! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink , by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson ’s Weekly , she might now be rolling in her carriage , second to none .
14260 !!! Nay , she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father , a prey to the fumes of intoxication , forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness , deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low .
14262 !!! And Gerty , rapt in thought , scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk .
14268 !!! The moon hath raised _ with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried , God have mercy on him , from a stroke .
14269 !!! Her mother ’s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken .
14270 !!! No - one would have thought the end was so near .
14272 !!! And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he could n’t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby ’s cork lino , artistic , standard designs , fit for a palace , gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home .
14273 !!! A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house , a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold .
14274 !!! And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she did n’t like her mother ’s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about , taking snuff .
14279 !!! She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat .
14281 !!! The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks .
14282 !!! Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball .
14283 !!! Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please .
14284 !!! The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty ’s skirt near the little pool by the rock .
14285 !!! The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball had n’t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed .
14286 !!! — If you fail try again , Edy Boardman said .
14287 !!! Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip .
14294 !!! And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered , their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary , the most pious Virgin ’s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her .
14295 !!! The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers .
14296 !!! Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee , clapping baby hands in air .
14297 !!! Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah !
14298 !!! and , my word , did n’t the little chap enjoy that !
14302 !!! And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health , a perfect little bunch of love , and he would certainly turn out to be something great , they said .
14304 !!! Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa
14309 !!! It was all no use soothering him with no , nono , baby , no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss , always readywitted , gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased .
14310 !!! Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves , no hour to be out , and the little brats of twins .
14312 !!! It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out , the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft .
14317 !!! People were so queer .
14322 !!! She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away .
14336 !!! Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church , the stained glass windows lighted up , the candles , the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin ’s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O’Hanlon at the altar , carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down .
14338 !!! He told her that time when she told him about that in confession , crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see , not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature ’s laws , he said , in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God , he said , and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word .
14341 !!! The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it .
14342 ::: Little monkeys common as ditchwater .
14343 !!! Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places , the both of them .
14344 !!! And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned .
14347 !!! So Cissy said it was the very last time she ’d ever bring them out .
14353 !!! That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness .
14354 !!! Queen of angels , queen of patriarchs , queen of prophets , of all saints , they prayed , queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O’Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she did n’t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O’Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the _ Tantum ergo _
14358 !!! Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature .
14359 !!! Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier , a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl ’s shoulders — a radiant little vision , in sooth , almost maddening in its sweetness .
14365 !!! Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty , half smiling , with her specs like an old maid , pretending to nurse the baby .
14366 !!! Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no - one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers .
14371 !!! And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy , as glib as you like , said it was half past kissing time , time to kiss again .
14372 !!! But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early .
14373 !!! — Wait , said Cissy , I ’ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what ’s the time by his conundrum .
14375 !!! Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself .
14377 !!! Cissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch , listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set .
14379 !!! Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order .
14380 !!! Then they sang the second verse of the _ Tantum ergo _ and Canon O’Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time .
14388 !!! Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins ’ caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O’Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out _ Panem de coelo praestitisti eis _ and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over .
14389 !!! Gerty winced sharply .
14391 !!! It hurt — O yes , it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was .
14392 !!! Gerty ’s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat , so slim , so flawless , so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of .
14394 !!! Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears .
14402 !!! Miss puny little Edy ’s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it , the little kinnatt , because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof , apart , in another sphere , that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it .
14403 !!! Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior .
14404 !!! And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky , laughing up out of his gleeful eyes , and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby , without as much as by your leave , sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib .
14410 !!! Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what
14412 !!! but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O’Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands .
14413 ::: How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight , the last glimpse of Erin , the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk , hither , thither , with a tiny lost cry .
14414 !!! And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book _
14417 !!! For Gerty had her dreams that no - one knew of .
14440 !!! She would try to understand him because men were so different .
14443 !!! She would follow , her dream of love , the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all , the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide .
14446 !!! Canon O’Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang _ Laudate Dominum omnes gentes _ and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked was n’t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out : — O , look , Cissy !
14448 !!! but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church , blue and then green and purple .
14449 !!! — It ’s fireworks , Cissy Caffrey said .
14451 !!! — Come on , Gerty , Cissy called .
14453 !!! But Gerty was adamant .
14461 !!! She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no - one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that , supply soft and delicately rounded , and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart , his hoarse breathing , because she knew too about the passion of men like that , hotblooded , because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she ’d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed .
14463 !!! Besides there was absolution so long as you did n’t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too , my dear , and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors ’ photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did .
14464 !!! And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look , there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look , look , there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air , a soft thing , to and fro , dark .
14467 !!! and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no - one ever not even on the swing or wading and she was n’t ashamed and he was n’t either to look in that immodest way like that because he could n’t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking , looking .
14480 !!! Leopold Bloom ( for it is he ) stands silent , with bowed head before those young guileless eyes .
14483 !!! A fair unsullied soul had called to him and , wretch that he was , how had he answered ?
14487 !!! Should a girl tell ?
14489 ::: That was their secret , only theirs , alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats do n’t tell .
14490 !!! Cissy Caffrey whistled , imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was : and then she cried : —
14495 !!! Gerty had an idea , one of love ’s little ruses .
14507 !!! She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because — because Gerty MacDowell was ... Tight boots ?
14511 !!! Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away .
14529 !!! Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil .
14530 !!! Virgins go mad in the end I suppose .

14822 !!! Something the nurse taught me .
14844 !!! And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks .
14869 !!! Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin ’s barn a blind .
14879 !!! Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa ’s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller ’s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah .
14892 !!! Wonder is nurse Callan there still .
14893 !!! She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace .
14895 !!! And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too , marriageable .
14896 !!! Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms .
14897 !!! Husband rolling in drunk , stink of pub off him like a polecat .

15579 !!! Because it was a little canarybird that came out of its little house to tell the time that Gerty MacDowell noticed the time she was there because she was as quick as anything about a thing like that , was Gerty MacDowell , and she noticed at once that that foreign gentleman that was sitting on the rocks looking was Cuckoo Cuckoo Cuckoo .
15590 !!! For who is there who anything of some significance has apprehended but is conscious that that exterior splendour may be the surface of a downwardtending lutulent reality or on the contrary anyone so is there unilluminated as not to perceive that as no nature ’s boon can contend against the bounty of increase so it behoves every most just citizen to become the exhortator and admonisher of his semblables and to tremble lest what had in the past been by the nation excellently commenced might be in the future not with similar excellence accomplished if an inverecund habit shall have gradually traduced the honourable by ancestors transmitted customs to that thither of profundity that that one was audacious excessively who would have the hardihood to rise affirming that no more odious offence can for anyone be than to oblivious neglect to consign that evangel simultaneously command and promise which on all mortals with prophecy of abundance or with diminution ’s menace that exalted of reiteratedly procreating function ever irrevocably enjoined ?
15595 !!! O thing of prudent nation not merely in being seen but also even in being related worthy of being praised that they her by anticipation went seeing mother , that she by them suddenly to be about to be cherished had been begun she felt !

And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice .
15639 !!! And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile .
15640 !!! Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility .
15642 !!! And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery .
15647 !!! And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer .
15652 !!! And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each .
15653 !!! And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile .
15656 !!! This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child , a gentle dame , whose time hied fast .
15657 !!! Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high
15664 !!! And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars ’ hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup .
15667 !!! There was a sort of scholars along either side the board , that is to wit , Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable ’s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden , scholars of medicine , and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa , one Crotthers , and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested ( and of all them , reserved young Stephen , he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead ) and beside the meek sir Leopold .
15669 !!! And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner .
15670 !!! Ruth red him , love led on with will to wander , loth to leave .
15672 !!! And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness , young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die ( for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne ’s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case ) .
15673 !!! And they said farther she should live because in the beginning , they said , the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die .
15674 !!! And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy .
15677 !!! but all cried with one acclaim nay , by our Virgin Mother , the wife should live and the babe to die .
15678 !!! In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack .
15679 !!! Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved .
15680 !!! To whom young Stephen had these words following : Murmur , sirs , is eke oft among lay folk .
15681 !!! Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker , the one in limbo gloom , the other in purgefire .
15685 !!! Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends .
15687 !!! Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi ’s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn , the other all this while , pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him , witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do .
15689 !!! Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom , of law of canons , of Lilith , patron of abortions , of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or , as Virgilius saith , by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with , _ effectu secuto _ , or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides .
15690 !!! He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God ’s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman ’s seal , even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded .
15692 !!! A wariness of mind he would answer as fitted all and , laying hand to jaw , he said dissembling , as his wo nt was , that as it was informed him , who had ever loved the art of physic as might a layman , and agreeing also with his experience of so seldomseen an accident it was good for that mother Church belike at one blow had birth and death pence and in such sort deliverly he scaped their questions .
15693 !!! That is truth , pardy , said Dixon , and , or I err , a pregnant word .
15694 !!! Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons .
15695 !!! But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny .
15696 !!! And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb ’s wool , the flower of the flock , lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled ( for it was then about the midst of the winter ) and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend ’s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage ( for all accounted him of real parts ) so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores .
15697 !!! About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who , praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff , he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray .
15704 !!! His words were then these as followeth : Know all men , he said , time ’s ruins build eternity ’s mansions .
15715 !!! and then stands she in the one denial or ignorancy with Peter Piscator who lives in the house that Jack built and with Joseph the joiner patron of the happy demise of all unhappy marriages ,
15716 !!! _ parceque M. Léo Taxil nous a dit que qui l’avait mise dans cette fichue position c’était le sacré pigeon , ventre de Dieu !
15723 !!! Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch _ Staboo Stabella _ about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack : _
15725 !!! It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking , in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage , nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided
15728 !!! To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles , goodly grinning , asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar ’s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb , chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days .
15729 !!! Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how , as he heard hereof counted , he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too , waxing merry and toasting to his fathership .
15731 !!! Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses , as the priests use in Madagascar island , she to be in guise of white and saffron , her groom in white and grain , with burning of nard and tapers , on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem _
15737 !!! Well met they were , said Master Dixon , joyed , but , harkee , young sir , better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for , by my troth , of such a mingling much might come .
15738 !!! Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it .
15739 !!! Greater love than this , he said , no man hath that a man lay down his wife for his friend .
15748 !!! Return , return , Clan Milly : forget me not , O Milesian .
15749 !!! Why hast thou done this abomination before me that thou didst spurn me for a merchant of jalaps and didst deny me to the Roman and to the Indian of dark speech with whom thy daughters did lie luxuriously ?
15754 !!! Assuefaction minorates atrocities ( as Tully saith of his darling Stoics ) and Hamlet his father showeth the prince no blister of combustion .
15757 !!! The aged sisters draw us into life : we wail , batten , sport , clip , clasp , sunder , dwindle , die : over us dead they bend .
15759 !!! And as no man knows the ubicity of his tumulus nor to what processes we shall thereby be ushered nor whether to Tophet or to Edenville in the like way is all hidden when we would backward see from what region of remoteness the whatness of our whoness hath fetched his whenceness .
15760 !!! Thereto Punch Costello roared out mainly _
15766 !!! Loud on left Thor thundered : in anger awful the hammerhurler .
15768 !!! And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry .
15770 !!! Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour .
15771 !!! But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead .
15773 !!! He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden , being godly certain whiles , knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom , at the braggart ’s side , spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear , advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard , the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead , look you , having taken place , and all of the order of a natural phenomenon .
15780 !!! Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or , what Calmer said , a hubbub of Phenomenon ?
15785 !!! By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law .
15787 !!! Yes , Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name , she said , is Bird - in - the - Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as , Ho , you pretty man , turn aside hither
15790 !!! For regarding Believe - on - Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for , first , Two - in - the - Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them , Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and , second , for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and , third , that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild .
15791 !!! So were they all in their blind fancy , Mr Cavil and Mr Sometimes Godly , Mr Ape Swillale , Mr False Franklin , Mr Dainty Dixon , Young Boasthard and Mr Cautious Calmer .
15794 !!! Dignam laid in clay of an apoplexy and after hard drought , please God , rained , a bargeman coming in by water a fifty mile or thereabout with turf saying the seed wo n’t sprout , fields athirst , very sadcoloured and stunk mightily , the quags and tofts too .
15795 !!! Hard to breathe and all the young quicks clean consumed without sprinkle this long while back as no man remembered to be without .
15803 !!! Mulligan a gentleman ’s gentleman that had but come from Mr Moore ’s the writer ’s ( that was a papish but is now , folk say , a good Williamite ) chanced against Alec .
15804 !!! Bannon in a cut bob ( which are now in with dance cloaks of Kendal green ) that was new got to town from Mullingar with the stage where his coz and Mal M ’s brother will stay a month yet till Saint Swithin and asks what in the earth he does there , he bound home and he to Andrew Horne ’s being stayed for to crush a cup of wine , so he said , but would tell him of a skittish heifer , big of her age and beef to the heel , and all this while poured with rain and so both together on to Horne ’s .
15807 !!! Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better , he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there , that got in through pleading her belly , and now on the stools , poor body , two days past her term , the midwives sore put to it and ca n’t deliver , she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks , they say , but God give her soon issue .
15810 !!! In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi ’s almanac ( and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer ’s gazette ) to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how .
15815 !!! and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue , some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother ’s son of them would burst their sides .
15820 !!! _ Mort aux vaches _ , says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too .
15821 !!! From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father , a headborough , who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes , matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes .
15824 !!! What , says Mr Leopold with his hands across , that was earnest to know the drift of it , will they slaughter all ?
15830 !!! Mr Stephen , a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor ’s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality , that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest , the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy , with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns .
15831 !!! Come , come , says Mr Vincent , plain dealing .
15833 !!! Irish by name and irish by nature , says Mr Stephen , and he sent the ale purling about , an Irish bull in an English chinashop .
15834 !!! I conceive you , says Mr Dixon .
15836 !!! True for you , says Mr Vincent cross the table , and a bullseye into the bargain , says he , and a plumper and a portlier bull , says he , never shit on shamrock .
15837 !!! He had horns galore , a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island , leaving doughballs and rollingpins , followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains .
15838 !!! What for that , says Mr Dixon , but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself .
15839 !!! So be off now , says he , and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer ’s blessing , and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly .
15840 !!! But the slap and the blessing stood him friend , says Mr Vincent , for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid , wife , abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland .
15842 !!! By this time the father of the faithful ( for so they called him ) was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture .
15843 !!! To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls ’ language and they all after him .
15844 !!! Ay , says another , and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself ( for that was the only colour to his mind ) and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice , saying : By the Lord Harry , Green is the grass that grows on the ground .
15845 !!! And , says Mr Dixon , if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he ’d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry ’s orders .
15846 !!! There was bad blood between them at first , says Mr Vincent , and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ’ll meddle in his matters , says he .
15847 !!! I ’ll make that animal smell hell , says he , with the help of that good pizzle my father left me .
15848 !!! But one evening , says Mr Dixon , when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace ( he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks ) he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans , _ Bos Bovum _ , which is good bog Latin for boss of the show .
15849 !!! After that , says Mr Vincent , the lord Harry put his head into a cow ’s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name .
15852 !!! They were , says Mr Stephen , and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward , as the ungrate women were all of one mind , made a wherry raft , loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard , set all masts erect , manned the yards , sprang their luff , heaved to , spread three sheets in the wind , put her head between wind and water , weighed anchor , ported her helm , ran up the jolly Roger , gave three times three , let the bullgine run , pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America .
15853 !!! Which was the occasion , says Mr Vincent , of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty : _ — Pope Peter ’s but a pissabed .
15856 !!! Our worthy acquaintance Mr Malachi Mulligan now appeared in the doorway as the students were finishing their apologue accompanied with a friend whom he had just rencountered , a young gentleman , his name Alec Bannon , who had late come to town , it being his intention to buy a colour or a cornetcy in the fencibles and list for the wars .
15857 !!! Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on .
15862 !!! Well , let us hear of it , good my friend , said Mr Dixon .
15866 !!! Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and , expatiating upon his design , told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility , both the inhibitory and the prohibitory , whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired .
15867 !!! It grieved him plaguily , he said , to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges : and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures , a prey to the vilest bonzes , who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness , sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress , this , he assured them , made his heart weep .
15871 !!! The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion , if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions , would find in him their man .
15875 !!! His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary ’s excepted to it , asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle .
15876 !!! Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which , as it dwelt upon his memory , seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention : _
15879 !!! The young gentleman , his friend , overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him , could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour .
15880 !!! Mr Mulligan , now perceiving the table , asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and , seeing the stranger , he made him a civil bow and said , Pray , sir , was you in need of any professional assistance we could give ?
15882 !!! Mr Dixon , to turn the table , took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence , upon which he rallied him , betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due , as with the noted physician , Mr Austin Meldon , to a wolf in the stomach .
15883 !!! For answer Mr Mulligan , in a gale of laughter at his smalls , smote himself bravely below the diaphragm , exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan ( the most excellent creature of her sex though ’ tis pity she ’s a trollop ):
15887 !!! Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student , a little fume of a fellow , blond as tow , congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and , interrupting the narrative at a salient point , having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head ( a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture ) to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it .
15915 !!! No woman of any wit would wear one .
15916 !!! My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for , as she reminded me ( blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies ) , dame Nature , by the divine blessing , has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that _
15918 !!! The first , said she ( and here my pretty philosopher , as I handed her to her tilbury , to fix my attention , gently tipped with her tongue the outer chamber of my ear ) , the first is a bath ...
15920 !!! Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and , while all were conjecturing what might be the cause , Miss Callan entered and , having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon , retired with a profound bow to the company .
15922 !!! Strike me silly , said Costello , a low fellow who was fuddled .
15927 !!! Gad ’s bud , immensely so , said Mr Lynch .
15929 !!! Demme , does not Doctor O’Gargle chuck the nuns there under the chin .
15931 !!! Lawksamercy , doctor , cried the young blood in the primrose vest , feigning a womanish simper and with immodest squirmings of his body , how you do tease a body !
15937 !!! The young surgeon , however , rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward .
15938 !!! Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was _ enceinte _ which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy .
15949 !!! Stap my vitals , said he , them was always the sentiments of honest Frank Costello which I was bred up most particular to honour thy father and thy mother that had the best hand to a rolypoly or a hasty pudding as you ever see what I always looks back on with a loving heart .
15951 !!! The young sparks , it is true , were as full of extravagancies as overgrown children : the words of their tumultuary discussions were difficultly understood and not often nice : their testiness and outrageous _ mots _ were such that his intellects resiled from : nor were they scrupulously sensible of the proprieties though their fund of strong animal spirits spoke in their behalf .
15953 !!! It was now for more than the middle span of our allotted years that he had passed through the thousand vicissitudes of existence and , being of a wary ascendancy and self a man of rare forecast , he had enjoined his heart to repress all motions of a rising choler and , by intercepting them with the readiest precaution , foster within his breast that plenitude of sufferance which base minds jeer at , rash judgers scorn and all find tolerable and but tolerable .
15959 !!! The dressy young blade said it was her husband ’s that put her in that expectation or at least it ought to be unless she were another Ephesian matron .
15960 !!! I must acquaint you , said Mr Crotthers , clapping on the table so as to evoke a resonant comment of emphasis , old Glory Allelujurum was round again today , an elderly man with dundrearies , preferring through his nose a request to have word of Wilhelmina , my life , as he calls her .
15966 !!! Singular , communed the guest with himself , the wonderfully unequal faculty of metempsychosis possessed by them , that the puerperal dormitory and the dissecting theatre should be the seminaries of such frivolity , that the mere acquisition of academic titles should suffice to transform in a pinch of time these votaries of levity into exemplary practitioners of an art which most men anywise eminent have esteemed the noblest .
15974 !!! Unhappy woman , she has been too long and too persistently denied her legitimate prerogative to listen to his objurgations with any other feeling than the derision of the desperate .
15976 !!! Nay , had the hussy ’s scouringbrush not been her tutelary angel , it had gone with her as hard as with Hagar , the Egyptian !
15989 !!! one ear could hear what the other spoke , the benefits of anesthesia or twilight sleep , the prolongation of labour pains in advanced gravidancy by reason of pressure on the vein , the premature relentment of the amniotic fluid ( as exemplified in the actual case ) with consequent peril of sepsis to the matrix , artificial insemination by means of syringes , involution of the womb consequent upon the menopause , the problem of the perpetration of the species in the case of females impregnated by delinquent rape , that distressing manner of delivery called by the Brandenburghers _ Sturzgeburt , _ the recorded instances of multiseminal , twikindled and monstrous births conceived during the catamenic period or of consanguineous parents — in a word all the cases of human nativity which Aristotle has classified in his masterpiece with chromolithographic illustrations .
15993 !!! An outlandish delegate sustained against both these views , with such heat as almost carried conviction , the theory of copulation between women and the males of brutes , his authority being his own avouchment in support of fables such as that of the Minotaur which the genius of the elegant Latin poet has handed down to us in the pages of his Metamorphoses .
15997 !!! Hitherto silent , whether the better to show by preternatural gravity that curious dignity of the garb with which he was invested or in obedience to an inward voice , he delivered briefly and , as some thought , perfunctorily the ecclesiastical ordinance forbidding man to put asunder what God has joined .
16014 !!! Distractions , rookshooting , the Erse language ( he recited some ) , laudanum ( he raised the phial to his lips ) , camping out .
16016 !!! His spectre stalks me .
16017 !!! Dope is my only hope ...
16024 !!! Tears gushed from the eyes of the dissipated host .
16025 !!! The seer raised his hand to heaven , murmuring : The vendetta of Mananaun !
16026 !!! The sage repeated : _ Lex talionis _ .
16027 !!! The sentimentalist is he who would enjoy without incurring the immense debtorship for a thing done .
16028 !!! Malachias , overcome by emotion , ceased .
16030 !!! Haines was the third brother .
16032 ::: The black panther was himself the ghost of his own father .
16036 !!! No soul will live there .
16037 ::: The spider pitches her web in the solitude .
16044 !!! No longer is Leopold , as he sits there , ruminating , chewing the cud of reminiscence , that staid agent of publicity and holder of a modest substance in the funds .
16058 !!! The wise father knows his own child .
16071 !!! In terror the poor girl flees away through the murk .

16171 !!! Theosophos told me so , Stephen answered , whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law .
16172 !!! The lords of the moon , Theosophos told me , an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation .
16174 !!! The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop .
16176 !!! He was simply and solely , as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself , which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings , after the moment before ’s observations about boyhood days and the turf , recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn .
16180 !!! The debaters were the keenest in the land , the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital .

16184 !!! There too , opposite to him , was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom .
16185 !!! Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello , the eccentric , while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden .
16187 !!! Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion , while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator , fresh from the hippodrome , and that vigilant wanderer , soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour , but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come .

16207 !!! Still the plain straightforward question why a child of normally healthy parents and seemingly a healthy child and properly looked after succumbs unaccountably in early childhood ( though other children of the same marriage do not ) must certainly , in the poet ’s words , give us pause .
16208 ::: Nature , we may rest assured , has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence ( modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal ) tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development , an arrangement which , though productive of pain to some of our feelings ( notably the maternal ) , is nevertheless , some of us think , in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest .

I. ) is the able and popular master , he is reported by eyewitnesses as having stated that once a woman has let the cat into the bag ( an esthete ’s allusion , presumably , to one of the most complicated and marvellous of all nature ’s processes — the act of sexual congress )

22537 !!! _ ( The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly .
22540 !!! The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat .
22541 !!! Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply .
22542 !!! With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done .
22543 !!! With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs .
22545 !!! Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand .
22547 !!! The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay .
22548 !!! Bloom , holding in his hand Stephen ’s hat , festooned with shavings , and ashplant , stands irresolute .
22583 !!! What ? STEPHEN : _ ( Murmurs . )
22601 !!! Best thing could happen him .
22611 !!! _ BLOOM : _ ( Wonderstruck , calls inaudibly . )
22617 ::: A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket . )
22618 !!! _ — III — [ 16 ] Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed .
22621 !!! For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned .
22624 !!! But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler , probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree , outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom , who was anything but a professional whistler , endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle , holding his arms arched over his head , twice .
22628 !!! As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company ’s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion _ à propos _ of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back .
22630 !!! Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen , associated with Baird ’s the stonecutter ’s in his mind somehow in Talbot place , first turning on the right , while the other who was acting as his _ fidus Achates _ inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke ’s city bakery , situated quite close to where they were , the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread , of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable .
22633 !!! En route _ to his taciturn and , not to put too fine a point on it , not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties , never more so , in fact disgustingly sober , spoke a word of caution _ re _ the dangers of nighttown , women of ill fame and swell mobsmen , which , barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice , was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you did n’t look out .
22634 !!! Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or , failing that , the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or , he being the solicitor rather , old Wall , he meant to say , or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about .
22635 !!! The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen , whom he cordially disliked , were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and , as Mr Bloom put it , recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street , prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot .
22636 !!! Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city , Pembroke road for example , the guardians of the law were well in evidence , the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes .
22641 !!! — And that one was Judas , Stephen said , who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind .
22643 !!! Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox .
22646 !!! — Someone saluted you , Mr Bloom said .
22649 !!! Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the _ qui vive _ with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least .
22650 !!! Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper , famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment ’s notice , your money or your life , leaving you there to point a moral , gagged and garrotted .
22651 !!! Stephen , that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters , though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley ’s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice .
22652 !!! Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise .
22654 !!! His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine ( also ) Talbot .
22655 !!! Rumour had it ( though not proved ) that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion , really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing , her mother or aunt or some relative , a woman , as the tale went , of extreme beauty , had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen .
22659 !!! His friends had all deserted him .
22664 !!! — I would n’t ask you only , pursued he , on my solemn oath and God knows I ’m on the rocks .
22665 !!! — There ’ll be a job tomorrow or next day , Stephen told him , in a boys ’ school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher .
22669 !!! — Ah , God , Corley replied , sure I could n’t teach in a school , man .
22672 !!! — I have no place to sleep myself , Stephen informed him .
22674 !!! There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street , Mrs Maloney ’s , but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M’Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street ( which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon ) for a bob .
22677 !!! However _ haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco etcetera _ as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished .
22687 !!! — Those are halfcrowns , man , Corley corrected him .
22689 !!! Stephen anyhow lent him one of them .
22690 !!! — Thanks , Corley answered , you ’re a gentleman .
22695 !!! I ’d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they ’re full up for the next three weeks , man .
22696 !!! God , you ’ve to book ahead , man , you ’d think it was for the Carl Rosa .
22698 !!! Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam ’s , the shipchandler ’s , bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle ’s back with O’Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe .
22700 !!! Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman ’s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work , it struck him , was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept .
22703 !!! Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round , in every deep , so to put it , a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very _ rara avis _ altogether .
22709 !!! At this intelligence , in which he seemingly evinced little interest , Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger , rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana , moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair , whereupon he observed evasively : — Everybody gets their own ration of luck , they say .
22711 !!! But , leaving that for the moment , how much did you part with , he queried , if I am not too inquisitive ? — Half a crown , Stephen responded .
22714 !!! Mr Bloom ejaculated , professing not the least surprise at the intelligence , I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does .
22721 !!! — I met your respected father on a recent occasion , Mr Bloom diplomatically returned , today in fact , or to be strictly accurate , on yesterday .
22724 !!! — I believe he is in Dublin somewhere , Stephen answered unconcernedly .
22725 !!! Why ? — A gifted man , Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior , in more respects than one and a born _ raconteur _
22728 !!! You could go back perhaps , he hasarded , still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two , Mulligan , that is , and that English tourist friend of his , who eventually euchred their third companion , were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion , which they did .
22729 !!! There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however , such as it was , Stephen ’s mind ’s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle , her hair hanging down , waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy , Boody and Katey , the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper , in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded , it being quarter tense or if not , ember days or something like that .
22730 !!! — No , Mr Bloom repeated again , I would n’t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element , Dr Mulligan , as a guide , philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes .
22734 !!! He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man , by no means confined to medicine only , who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and , if the report was verified , bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries , or Malahide was it ? , was , he was bound to admit , an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise , so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy , pure and simple .
22752 !!! Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman ’s shelter , an unpretentious wooden structure , where , prior to then , he had rarely if ever been before , the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin - the - Goat Fitzharris , the invincible , though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in .
22754 !!! — Now touching a cup of coffee , Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice , it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food , say , a roll of some description .
22757 !!! Mr Bloom , availing himself of the right of free speech , he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute , though , to be sure , rather in a quandary over _ voglio _ , remarked to his _ protégé _ in an audible tone of voice _ à propos _ of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious : — A beautiful language .
22765 !!! Stephen , who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could , suffering from lassitude generally , replied : — To fill the ear of a cow elephant .
22768 !!! Mr Bloom asked .
22770 !!! The keeper of the shelter in the middle of this _ tête - à - tête _ put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun , or so it seemed .
22771 !!! After which he beat a retreat to his counter , Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to .
22773 !!! — Sounds are impostures , Stephen said after a pause of some little time , like names .
22776 !!! Shakespeares were as common as Murphies .
22777 !!! What ’s in a name ? — Yes , to be sure , Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred .
22780 !!! The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen , whom he had singled out for attention in particular , squarely by asking : — And what might your name be ?
22781 !!! Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion ’s boot but Stephen , apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter , answered : — Dedalus .
22782 !!! The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes , rather bunged up from excessive use of boose , preferably good old Hollands and water .
22785 !!! — I ’ve heard of him , Stephen said .
22786 !!! Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment , seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too .
22787 !!! — He ’s Irish , the seaman bold affirmed , staring still in much the same way and nodding .
22788 !!! All Irish . — All too Irish , Stephen rejoined .
22789 !!! As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark : — I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder .
22802 !!! — Buffalo Bill shoots to kill , Never missed nor he never will . _
22804 !!! — Beg pardon , the sailor said . — Long ago ?
22805 !!! Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth .
22806 !!! — Why , the sailor replied , relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond , it might be a matter of ten years .
22809 !!! — Curious coincidence , Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively . — Murphy ’s my name , the sailor continued .
22810 !!! D. B. Murphy of Carrigaloe . Know where that is ? — Queenstown harbour , Stephen replied .
22811 !!! — That ’s right , the sailor said .
22816 !!! My little woman ’s down there .
22821 !!! Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene , the homecoming to the mariner ’s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones , a rainy night with a blind moon .
22824 !!! Never about the runaway wife coming back , however much devoted to the absentee .
22826 !!! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half , wrecked in his affections .
22840 !!! The sailor , who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident , turned to one of the jarvies with the request : — You do n’t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you ?
22841 !!! The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand .
22842 !!! — Thank you , the sailor said .
22853 !!! — You must have seen a fair share of the world , the keeper remarked , leaning on the counter . — Why , the sailor answered upon reflection upon it , I ’ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on .
22862 !!! That ’s how the Russians prays .
22864 !!! — Why , the sailor said , shifting his partially chewed plug .
22866 ::: I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid .
22872 !!! A friend of mine sent me .
22884 !!! Nobody volunteering a statement he winked , saying : — Glass .
22887 !!! Mr Bloom , without evincing surprise , unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark .
22891 !!! Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated ( or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo - Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in _ Maritana _ on which occasion the former ’s ball passed through the latter ’s hat ) having detected a discrepancy between his name ( assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t . somewhere ) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend ’s _ bona fides _
22893 !!! Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through .
22906 !!! after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life .
22912 !!! Cooks rats in your soup , he appetisingly added , the chinks does .
22913 !!! Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on , adhering to his adventures .
22919 !!! Fellow hid behind a door , come up behind him .
22930 !!! Mr B. and Stephen , each in his own particular way , both instinctively exchanged meaning glances , in a religious silence of the strictly _
22933 !!! the keeper , not turning a hair , was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair .
22937 !!! One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal , another the card with the natives _ choza de _ , another the seaman ’s discharge .
22938 !!! Mr Bloom , so far as he was personally concerned , was just pondering in pensive mood .
22939 !!! He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday , roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles , when it took the civilised world by storm , figuratively speaking , early in the eighties , eightyone to be correct , when he was just turned fifteen . — Ay , boss , the sailor broke in .
22943 !!! Mr Bloom inquired .
22944 !!! The sailor grimaced , chewing , in a way that might be read as yes , ay or no . — Ah , you ’ve touched there too , Mr Bloom said , Europa point , thinking he had , in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so , simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust , and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn .
22946 !!! Mr B interrogated .
22948 !!! Our _ soi - disant _ sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering : — I ’m tired of all them rocks in the sea , he said , and boats and ships .
22951 !!! His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer , fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe , suffice it to say that , as a casual glance at the map revealed , it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves .
22961 !!! There ’s my son now , Danny , run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper ’s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money . — What age is he ?
22963 !!! — Why , the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance , my son , Danny ? He ’d be about eighteen now , way I figure it .
22971 !!! — Tattoo , the exhibitor explained .
22973 !!! Fellow , the name of Antonio , done that .
22982 !!! And in point of fact the young man named Antonio ’s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin - the - Goat , who this time stretched over .
22983 !!! — Ay , ay , sighed the sailor , looking down on his manly chest .
22988 !!! — Neat bit of work , one longshoreman said . —
22998 !!! Mr Bloom , scarcely knowing which way to look , turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm , and , picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey , if such he was , had laid aside , he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink .
22999 !!! His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay , the partially idiotic female , namely , of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you ( Mrs B. ) and begged the chance of his washing .
23001 !!! Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife ’s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man ’s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper ’s marking ink ( hers were , that is ) if they really loved him , that is to say , love me , love my dirty shirt .
23002 !!! Still just then , being on tenterhooks , he desired the female ’s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off .
23006 !!! — The gunboat , the keeper said . — It beats me , Mr Bloom confided to Stephen , medically I am speaking , how a wretched creature like that from the Lock hospital reeking with disease can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses , if he values his health in the least .
23008 !!! Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition .
23009 !!! Still no matter what the cause is from ... Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders , merely remarking : — In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade .
23013 !!! The elder man , though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude , said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to _ instanter _ to say that women of that stamp ( quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject ) , a necessary evil , were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities , a thing , he could truthfully state , he , as a _ paterfamilias _ , was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start .
23019 !!! Do you ? Thus cornered , Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say : — They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible .
23021 !!! Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple , promptly rejoining : — Simple ?
23024 !!! But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison , though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man , I mean , and the same applies to the laws , for example , of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it ’s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God .
23025 !!! — O that , Stephen expostulated , has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ , apart from circumstantial evidence .
23038 !!! — Could n’t , Stephen contrived to get out , his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further .
23041 !!! Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance ( and lucrative ) work .
23049 !!! Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage . — Still it ’s solid food , his good genius urged , I ’m a stickler for solid food , his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the _ sine qua non _ for any kind of proper work , mental or manual .
23052 !!! — Liquids I can eat , Stephen said .
23056 !!! Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article , a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye , observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it .
23064 !!! He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told , as people often did about others , namely , that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage ( no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet ) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described .
23066 !!! And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself could n’t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him .
23073 !!! Ledwidge , when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the _ Flying Dutchman _ , a stupendous success , and his host of admirers came in large numbers , everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort , phantom or the reverse , on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains ) there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it , he conceded .
23075 !!! — Spaniards , for instance , he continued , passionate temperaments like that , impetuous as Old Nick , are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen .
23077 !!! My wife is , so to speak , Spanish , half that is .
23083 !!! — The temperaments at the door , Stephen interposed with , were very passionate about ten shillings .
23086 !!! — Quite so , Mr Bloom dittoed .
23087 !!! — Then , Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere , we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino .
23088 !!! — It ’s in the blood , Mr Bloom acceded at once .
23097 !!! Interest , however , was starting to flag somewhat all round
23099 !!! Shipahoy of course had his own say to say .
23101 !!! So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt ’s rock , wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it _
23103 !!! That was the talk of the town that year ( Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish _ Times _ ) , breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror .
23106 !!! Her master , the _ Mona _ ’s , said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way .
23109 !!! It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat . — Let me cross your bows mate , he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze .
23112 !!! The irrepressible Bloom , who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes , could by straining just perceive him , when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit , gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved .
23113 !!! Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor , evidently giving it a wide berth , eased himself closer at hand , the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank .
23115 !!! Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who , though now broken down and fast breaking up , was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid , now practically on the parish rates , given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus , a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool £ 100 a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of .
23121 !!! There were wrecks and wreckers , the keeper said , who was evidently _ au fait _ .
23131 !!! Skin - the - Goat , assuming he was he , evidently with an axe to grind , was airing his grievances in a forcible - feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God ’s earth , far and away superior to England , with coal in large quantities , six million pounds worth of pork exported every year , ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein .
23137 !!! The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin , he affirmed .
23138 !!! The Boers were the beginning of the end .
23139 !!! Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland , her Achilles heel , which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles , the Greek hero , a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot .
23141 !!! Ireland , Parnell said , could not spare a single one of her sons .
23143 !!! The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings , undismayed .
23146 !!! the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated .
23151 !!! — That ’s right , the old tarpaulin corroborated .
23155 !!! While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire , ours or his , and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it .
23157 !!! From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for , pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for , he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel , unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for , rather concealed their strength than the opposite .
23158 ::: It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if , as time went on , that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies , equally relevant to the issue , might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart .
23159 !!! Another little interesting point , the amours of whores and chummies , to put it in common parlance , reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her , more so , in fact .
23164 !!! Yet , though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form , he certainly did feel and no denying it ( while inwardly remaining what he was ) a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife , cold steel , with the courage of his political convictions ( though , personally , he would never be a party to any such thing ) , off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south , have her or swing for her , when the husband frequently , after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal ( he having had the pair watched ) , inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial _ liaison _ by plunging his knife into her , until it just struck him that Fitz , nicknamed Skin - the - Goat , merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not , if he was reliably informed , actually party to the ambush which , in point of fact , was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on .
23169 !!! So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some £ .
23178 !!! He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it was n’t all exactly . — _ Ex quibus _ , Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent , their two or four eyes conversing , _ Christus _ or Bloom his name is or after all any other , _ secundum carnem _ .
23179 !!! — Of course , Mr B. proceeded to stipulate , you must look at both sides of the question .
23187 !!! — Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes ’ war , Stephen assented , between Skinner ’s alley and Ormond market .
23188 !!! Yes , Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed , entirely endorsing the remark , that was overwhelmingly right .
23195 !!! History , would you be surprised to learn , proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell , an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for , imported them .
23200 !!! But in the economic , not touching religion , domain the priest spells poverty .
23201 !!! Spain again , you saw in the war , compared with goahead America .
23214 !!! Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee , listening to this synopsis of things in general , Stephen stared at nothing in particular .
23226 !!! You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has .
23230 !!! — You suspect , Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh , that I may be important because I belong to the _ faubourg Saint Patrice _ called Ireland for short .
23231 !!! — I would go a step farther , Mr Bloom insinuated .
23232 !!! — But I suspect , Stephen interrupted , that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me .
23236 !!! What was it you ... ? Stephen , patently crosstempered , repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely , adding : — We ca n’t change the country .
23241 !!! Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he had n’t been familiarised with the right sort of people .
23243 !!! For instance there was the case of O’Callaghan , for one , the halfcrazy faddist , respectably connected though of inadequate means , with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper ( a fact ) .
23246 !!! Briefly , putting two and two together , six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to , Antonio and so forth , jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne , then heir apparent , the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state , he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature , a thing good Mrs Grundy , as the law stands , was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it .
23247 !!! Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should , and every welltailored man must , trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two , she unbuttoned his
23256 !!! coalminers , divers , scavengers etc . , were very much under the microscope lately .
23260 !!! The pink edition extra sporting of the _ Telegraph _ tell a graphic lie lay , as luck would have it , beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again , far from satisfied , over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed A. Boudin find the captain ’s age , his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province the allembracing give us this day our daily press .
23279 !!! ( Hynes put it in of course ) _
23281 !!! The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted .
23282 !!! The obsequies , at which many friends of the deceased were present , were carried out _ ( certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny ) _ by Messrs H. J. O’Neill and Son , 164 North Strand Road .
23283 !!! The mourners included : Patk .
23285 !!! Henry Menton , solr , Martin Cunningham , John Power , eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora _ ( must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes ’s ad ) _
23291 !!! L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A. engaged in stifling another yawn , half nervousness , not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints .
23295 !!! Really , Mr Bloom said ( though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection ) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford ’s after all managing to .
23300 !!! Mr F. Alexander ’s _
23308 !!! It was anybody ’s race then the rank outsider drew to the fore , got long lead , beating Lord Howard de Walden ’s chestnut colt and Mr W. Bass ’s bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course .
23309 !!! Winner trained by Braime so that Lenehan ’s version of the business was all pure buncombe .
23312 !!! Also ran : J de Bremond ’s ( French horse Bantam Lyons was anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute ) _
23316 !!! Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left .
23322 !!! One morning you would open the paper , the cabman affirmed , and read : _
23325 !!! A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa .
23335 !!! All the same Bloom ( properly so dubbed ) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels and not singly but in their thousands and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years .
23340 !!! Alice , where art thou _ order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility .
23341 !!! Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure , a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet , whereas Messrs So and So who , though they were n’t even a patch on the former man , ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between .
23352 !!! And then , number one , you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials like the claimant in the Tichborne case , Roger Charles Tichborne , _ Bella _ was the boat ’s name to the best of his recollection he , the heir , went down in as the evidence went to show and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink , lord Bellew was it , as he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then , when got up to tally with the description given , introduce himself with : _ Excuse me , my name is So and So _ or some such commonplace remark .
23353 !!! A more prudent course , as Bloom said to the not over effusive , in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him , would have been to sound the lie of the land first .
23354 !!! — That bitch , that English whore , did for him , the shebeen proprietor commented .
23360 !!! The husband was a captain or an officer .
23361 !!! — Ay , Skin - the - Goat amusingly added , he was and a cottonball one .
23366 !!! Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch , with nothing in common between them beyond the name , and then a real man arriving on the scene , strong to the verge of weakness , falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties , the usual sequel , to bask in the loved one ’s smiles .
23372 !!! farewell , my gallant captain _ kind of an individual in the light dragoons , the 18th hussars to be accurate ) and inflammable doubtless ( the fallen leader , that is , not the other ) in his own peculiar way which she of course , woman , quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole , his erstwhile staunch adherents , and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations , very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose , thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass ’s kick .
23378 !!! And , if I do n’t greatly mistake she was Spanish too . — The king of Spain ’s daughter , Stephen answered , adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many .
23386 !!! Her ( the lady ’s ) eyes , dark , large , looked at Stephen , about to smile about something to be admired , Lafayette of Westmoreland street , Dublin ’s premier photographic artist , being responsible for the esthetic execution . — Mrs Bloom , my wife the _ prima donna _
23387 !!! Madam Marion Tweedy , Bloom indicated .
23391 !!! Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who , he intimated , was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen .
23399 !!! The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar ’s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself , her stage presence being , frankly , a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to .
23411 !!! Then the decree _ nisi _ and the King ’s proctor tries to show cause why and , he failing to quash it , _ nisi _ was made absolute .
23412 !!! But as for that the two misdemeanants , wrapped up as they largely were in one another , could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course .
23413 !!! He , B , enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin ’s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic _ fracas _ when the fallen leader ’s , who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery , ( leader ’s ) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the _ Insuppressible _
23417 !!! His hat ( Parnell ’s ) a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and , as a matter of strict history , Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him ( and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity ) who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he , as a matter of fact , having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else , what ’s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother ’s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect _ aplomb _ , saying : _ Thank you , sir _ , though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day , history repeating itself with a difference , after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave .
23418 !!! On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest , laughing immoderately , pretending to understand everything , the why and the wherefore , and in reality not knowing their own minds , it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones , who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another ’s arms , drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others .
23419 !!! He personally , being of a sceptical bias , believed and did n’t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady , even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument , when , neglecting her duties , she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent , the upshot being that her affections centred on another , the cause of many _ liaisons _ between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men , no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt .
23420 !!! It was a thousand pities a young fellow , blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was , should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime .
23421 !!! In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies ’ society was a _ conditio sine qua non _ though he had the gravest possible doubts , not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson ( who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning ) , as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ’ ways and flowers and chocs .
23426 !!! — Some time yesterday , Stephen said .
23428 !!! Ah , you mean it ’s after twelve ! — The day before yesterday , Stephen said , improving on himself .
23432 !!! For instance when the evicted tenants question , then at its first inception , bulked largely in people ’s mind though , it goes without saying , not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums , some of which would n’t exactly hold water , he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion ( a partiality , however , which , realising his mistake , he was subsequently partially cured of ) and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander , which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan ’s
23443 !!! A move had to be made because that merry old soul , the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot , did n’t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger ’s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character ’s whereabouts for a few days to come , alternately racking their feelings ( the mermaids ’ ) with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody ’s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address , as Mr Algebra remarks _ passim _ .
23447 !!! Your god was a jew .
23448 !!! Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick - on - Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo . — I propose , our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo , as it ’s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over .
23454 !!! The best plan clearly being to clear out , the remainder being plain sailing , he beckoned , while prudently pocketing the photo , to the keeper of the shanty who did n’t seem to . — Yes , that ’s the best , he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less .
23458 !!! The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy , earl Cadogan , had presided at the cabdrivers ’ association dinner in London somewhere .
23460 ::: Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary ’s lodge or words to that effect .
23463 !!! The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears .
23465 !!! the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried .
23471 !!! Red as a Rose is She . _
23472 !!! Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what , found drowned or the exploits of King Willow , Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts , during which time ( completely regardless of Ire ) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it , all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions , that is to say , either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark .
23473 !!! To cut a long story short Bloom , grasping the situation , was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost , being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion , taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming , making a grand total of fourpence ( the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers , literally the last of the Mohicans ) , he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures , coffee 2d , confectionery do , and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way , as Wetherup used to remark .
23476 !!! Stephen , who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out , paused at the , for a moment , the door .
23481 !!! The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins .
23482 !!! — It will ( the air ) do you good , Bloom said , meaning also the walk , in a moment .
23487 !!! — Yes , Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him , sinewless and wobbly and all that .
23488 !!! Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones , brazier etc . where the municipal supernumerary , ex Gumley , was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy , as the adage has it , dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new .
23497 !!! Stabat Mater _ , a work simply abounding in immortal numbers , in which his wife , Madam Marion Tweedy , made a hit , a veritable sensation , he might safely say , greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade , in the jesuit fathers ’ church in upper Gardiner street , the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos , or _ virtuosi _ rather .
23502 !!! Stephen , in reply to a politely put query , said he did n’t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare ’s songs , at least of in or about that period , the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist , who _ anno ludendo hausi , Doulandus _ , an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch , whom B. did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar , for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their _ dux _ and _ comes _ conceits and Byrd ( William ) who played the virginals , he said , in the Queen ’s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull .
23505 ::: By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn , which perceiving , Bloom , who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual , plucked the other ’s sleeve gently , jocosely remarking : — Our lives are in peril tonight .
23508 !!! Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas , suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new , a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker , a hipshaker , a blackbuttocker , a taildangler , a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch , busy with his thoughts .
23511 ::: But even a dog , he reflected , take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan ’s , of the same size , would be a holy horror to face .
23515 !!! These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen ’s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old .
23518 !!! My wife , he intimated , plunging _ in medias res _ , would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind .
23522 !!! Youth here has End _ by Jans Pieter Sweelinck , a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from .
23523 !!! Even more he liked an old German song of _ Johannes Jeep _ about the clear sea and the voices of sirens , sweet murderers of men , which boggled Bloom a bit : Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten .
23525 !!! Bloom , nodding , said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did .
23526 !!! A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that , the rarest of boons , which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out , could easily , if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain , command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an _ entrée _ into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. ( a huge ad in its way ) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success , being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites , if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he , a youthful tyro in society ’s sartorial niceties , hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you .
23537 ::: The horse was just then .
23539 ::: The horse having reached the end of his tether , so to speak , halted and , rearing high a proud feathering tail , added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish , three smoking globes of turds .
23541 !!! And humanely his driver waited till he ( or she ) had ended , patient in his scythed car .
23542 !!! Side by side Bloom , profiting by the _ contretemps _ , with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains , divided by the upright , and , stepping over a strand of mire , went across towards Gardiner street lower , Stephen singing more boldly , but not loudly , the end of the ballad .
23543 !!! Und alle Schiffe brücken .
23544 !!! The driver never said a word , good , bad or indifferent , but merely watched the two figures , as he sat on his lowbacked car , both black , one full , one lean , walk towards the railway bridge , _ to be married by Father Maher _ .
23545 !!! As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their _ tête à tête _ ( which , of course , he was utterly out of ) about sirens , enemies of man ’s reason , mingled with a number of other topics of the same category , usurpers , historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case could n’t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street _ and looked after their lowbacked car _ .

The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength , accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere , Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud ( perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin ) at first no bigger than a woman ’s hand .

E. , on the instructions of the waterworks committee had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption ( envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the impotable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893 ) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians , notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter , had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation , Mr Ignatius Rice , solicitor , thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public , selfsupporting taxpayers , solvent , sound .

24337 !!! but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too he s not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose I d have to dring it into him for a month
24339 !!! yes because they re so weak and puling when they re sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds you d think it was
24340 !!! O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid he d get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then we d see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do
24343 !!! not or he d be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah
24346 !!! and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and that s called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though I d like to find out so long as I do nt have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water 1 woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day
24351 !!! yes her aunt was very fond of oysters
24355 !!! that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon she s beaming love because he has an idea about him and me he s not such a fool he said I m dining out and going to the Gaiety though I m not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows he s a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I ca nt do it myself a young boy would like me
24356 !!! I d confuse him a little alone with him if we were I d let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop
24357 !!! yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine I m him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself
24359 !!! and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why ca nt you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you ca nt help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when he s there and kiss me in his arms there s nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down
24362 !!! and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I would nt mind feeling it neither would he I d say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he could nt see mine of course he d never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died they re lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them I d like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides there s no danger with a priest if you re married he s too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I did nt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed I m not a horse or an ass
24363 ::: am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur I d like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us
24366 !!! but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves they d know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you could nt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I do nt know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married I m sure he d have a fine strong child
24367 !!! but I do nt know Poldy has more spunk in him yes that d be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if that ll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming
24368 !!! and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I could nt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to
24371 !!! but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and was nt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake there s something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams
24372 !!! so I did nt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when he s there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I do nt wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she did nt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I could nt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had you re always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that was nt my fault she did nt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what she s got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me
24374 ::: yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too
24375 !!! and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now he s going about in his slippers to look for £ 10000 for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May would nt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that I d rather die 20 times over than marry another of their sex of course he d never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me
24377 !!! yes it was found out on her was nt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they ca nt get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper was nt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him he d say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged
24378 !!! O she did nt care if that was her nature what could she do besides they re not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they they re all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered 2 teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and
24382 !!! but he was nt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I do nt like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire was nt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots he d like me to walk in all the horses dung
24387 !!! what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said was nt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I do nt see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he had nt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise he d never have got me so cheap as he did he was 10 times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom
24392 !!! I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew do nt look at me professor I had to say I m
24395 !!! but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say you re out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was 1/4 after 3 when I saw the 2 Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly I d want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love
24397 !!! but you ca nt fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he did nt believe me no its better he s going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it had nt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he would nt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the 3rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too he s so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or they d have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him
24399 !!! well O I suppose there ll be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth I d like to find out something about him 1 or 2 tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where
24400 !!! its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I would nt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the _

24410 !!! and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it would nt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the 15 acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the 10th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers they re grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him they ve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me
24411 !!! but they d think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and he s not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones he s heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever

24513 !!! I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas she s as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we ca nt staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice

24520 ::: no there s no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers I d like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I do nt know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he was nt wanted if there was a row on you d vomit a better face there was no love lost between us that s 1 consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I could nt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I do nt like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose they re all dead and rotten long ago besides I do nt like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me
24522 !!! O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day you d never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news 20 years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face you d run miles away from I could nt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed I d cut them off him
24523 !!! so I would not that he d be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there is nt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only he d do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan that s why he did it
24524 !!! I m certain the way he plots and plans everything out I could nt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you ca nt see the join for 2 shillings would nt even teem the potatoes for you of course she s right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he ca nt say I pretend things can he I m too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat
24528 !!! and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life I d crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark they re always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away he s a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment
24533 !!! yet I never came properly till I was what 22 or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do they re usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost she s always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at 15 my powder too only ruin her skin on her
24534 !!! she s time enough for that all her life after of course she s restless knowing she s pretty with her lips so red a pity they wo nt stay that way I was too but there s no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we were nt grand enough till I gave her 2 damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I did nt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it
